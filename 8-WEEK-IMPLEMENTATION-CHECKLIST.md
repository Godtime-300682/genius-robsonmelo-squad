# 🚨 IF YOU GET STUCK

### Problem: "I'm behind on Week 1-2 setup"
**Solution:** Focus on ESSENTIAL only:
1. Quiz (basic, no fancy logic)
2. One landing page
3. ConvertKit email (3 emails only)
4. Skip Zapier for now (manual tag)
→ You can optimize later. Start generating traffic NOW.

### Problem: "No quiz completions in Week 3-4"
**Solution:**
1. Increase LinkedIn outreach (do 50 messages instead of 20)
2. Publish article on MORE platforms (5+ instead of 1)
3. Boost top LinkedIn post (R$100 budget)
4. Warm outreach might need personalization

### Problem: "Diagnostics scheduled but scared to deliver"
**Solution:**
1. You have all the frameworks (diagnostic, value conversation, proposal)
2. Practice once with a friend/colleague first
3. First diagnostic will feel awkward - that's normal
4. Second diagnostic is 2x better
→ Trust the process

### Problem: "Not converting diagnostics to proposals"
**Solution:**
1. Send proposal 24 hours after call (don't wait)
2. Make sure to quantify value in the call
3. Show 10:1 ROI math explicitly
4. Give 3 price options (not 1)
5. Follow up harder (2-3 follow-ups before giving up)

### Problem: "Not closing proposals"
**Solution:**
1. Price might be too high (offer payment plans)
2. Value conversation might need work
3. You might need stronger closer (practice closing objections)
4. They might not be ready (follow up in 30 days)
→ Don't give up after first "no"
