# Task: Codify Method - Transform Pattern into IP

## Metadata
- **Task ID:** GR-002
- **Type:** Method Creation
- **Estimated Duration:** 2-4 hours (deep work session)
- **Complexity:** High (Genius Zone activity)

## Purpose
Transform Robson's invisible pattern recognition into a documented, named, proprietary method that others can understand and buy.

## Input Required
- Domain/niche where pattern exists
- At least 10 similar client scenarios observed
- Initial hunch about the invisible pattern

## Elicitation
1. "In the last 12 months, what's a situation you've seen repeat 10+ times with different clients/contexts?"
2. "What do you see in that situation that others consistently miss?"
3. "When you point it out, what's the typical reaction? (e.g., 'I never thought of it that way')"
4. "What transformation happens when they see the pattern you see?"

## Process

### Step 1: Pattern Identification (@david-c-baker framework)
**Apply pattern-matching test:**
- Narrow observation sphere (tight positioning)
- Identify 10+ similar scenarios
- Extract the invisible connection/pattern

**Deliverable:** 2-3 sentence description of the pattern

### Step 2: Method Naming (@alan-weiss + @david-c-baker)
**Naming criteria:**
- Proprietary (unique to you)
- Memorable (easy to recall)
- Descriptive (hints at transformation)
- Not generic (e.g., NOT "Strategic Consulting Method")

**Examples:**
- "The Blind Spot Diagnostic"
- "The Pattern Shift Protocol"
- "The Invisible Leverage Framework"

**Deliverable:** Method name

### Step 3: Framework Documentation (@alan-weiss IP structure)
**Document:**
1. **The Problem** (what people can't see)
2. **The Pattern** (what you see that they don't)
3. **The Process** (3-7 steps to apply your insight)
4. **The Outcome** (transformation achieved)
5. **Why Only You** (unique positioning)

**Deliverable:** 1-page framework document

### Step 4: Validation Check (@david-c-baker)
**Ask:**
- Can someone read this and understand the value? ✓
- Does it articulate something they can't easily replicate? ✓
- Would you pay R$20K to access this insight if you had the problem? ✓

If all yes → Method codified ✅

## Output Example
```
METHOD CODIFIED: The Revenue Leak Diagnostic™

PROBLEM:
Mid-size B2B companies know revenue is "leaking" somewhere but can't pinpoint where. Traditional audits check obvious places (pricing, sales process) but miss the invisible pattern.

PATTERN YOU SEE:
Revenue leakage happens at handoff points between systems - not within them. It's the 48-hour gap between "prospect interested" and "account created" where 37% of deals die. Others audit systems; you audit the GAPS.

PROCESS:
1. Map all customer journey handoff points
2. Measure time-to-next-step at each handoff
3. Identify >24hr gaps (leak zones)
4. Redesign handoff triggers (automated)
5. Monitor leak closure (revenue recovered)

OUTCOME:
Clients recover 15-40% "lost" revenue by fixing invisible handoff gaps. Average: R$2.8M recovered per engagement.

WHY ONLY YOU:
You're the only one who identified that leaks happen BETWEEN systems, not within them. Positioning: "Handoff Revenue Recovery Specialist."

READY FOR PRICING:
- Value created: R$2.8M average
- 10:1 ROI fee: R$280K
- Practical pricing: R$150K-R$300K (choice of yeses)
```

## Veto Conditions
- VETO if <10 similar scenarios observed (positioning too broad)
- VETO if pattern is obvious to everyone (not invisible)
- VETO if transformation unclear or unmeasurable
- VETO if naming is generic (not proprietary)

## Completion Criteria
- Method has unique, proprietary name ✓
- Pattern articulated (what you see that others don't) ✓
- 3-7 step process documented ✓
- Transformation/outcome clear and measurable ✓
- Passes validation check (all 3 questions = yes) ✓

## Handoff To
- **@alan-weiss** - For value-based pricing of the method
- **@blair-enns** - For positioning and value conversation design
- **@donald-miller** - For crafting the transformation story
- **@sam-carpenter** - For documenting delivery procedures

## Quality Gate
**QG-GR-001: Method Codified** must pass before proceeding to offer design.
