# Task: Create Grand Slam Offer - High-Ticket Productization

## Metadata
- **Task ID:** GR-003
- **Type:** Offer Design
- **Estimated Duration:** 3-5 hours
- **Complexity:** High

## Purpose
Package Robson's codified method into a Grand Slam Offer (R$15K-R$30K) with clear value proposition, guarantee, bonus stack, and choice of yeses.

## Prerequisites
- **Required:** Method already codified (QG-GR-001 passed)
- **Required:** Pattern + transformation documented
- **Recommended:** At least 1 proof of concept / case study

## Input Required
- Codified method name and framework
- Target client profile
- Measurable transformation / ROI

## Process

### Step 1: Dream Outcome Definition (@alex-hormozi + @donald-miller)
**Answer:**
- What's the dream outcome for your ideal client?
- What does their life/business look like AFTER your method?
- What specific metrics change? (revenue, time, clarity, etc.)

**Deliverable:** 2-3 sentence dream outcome statement

### Step 2: Value Calculation (@alan-weiss 10:1 ROI formula)
**Calculate:**
```
Total Value = (Tangible Outcomes × Annualization) +
              (Intangible Outcomes × Emotional Impact) +
              Peripheral Benefits +
              Improved Variables
```

**Minimum fee = Total Value ÷ 10**

**Deliverable:** Value calculation showing R$150K-R$300K+ value created

### Step 3: Unique Mechanism (@alex-hormozi + @david-c-baker)
**Articulate:**
- What's the unique mechanism/process that creates the transformation?
- Why does YOUR method work when generic approaches fail?
- What's the "secret" invisible pattern you solve?

**Deliverable:** Unique mechanism statement (proprietary angle)

### Step 4: Guarantee Design (@alex-hormozi)
**Options:**
- **Outcome guarantee:** "If you don't achieve X result in 90 days, full refund"
- **Process guarantee:** "If you complete all steps and don't see X, full refund"
- **Satisfaction guarantee:** "100% refund within 30 days, no questions"

**Pick one that's bold but achievable.**

**Deliverable:** Guarantee statement

### Step 5: Bonus Stack (@alex-hormozi)
**Create 4-6 bonuses:**
- Each bonus has standalone value (R$1.5K-R$3K perceived value)
- Total bonus stack value > core offer price
- Bonuses accelerate results or remove obstacles

**Examples:**
- Bonus 1: Method Naming & Positioning Session (R$3K value)
- Bonus 2: High-Ticket Sales Deck Template (R$2.5K value)
- Bonus 3: First 5 Clients Targeting Map (R$1.5K value)
- Bonus 4: Live Proposal Review (R$2K value)

**Deliverable:** 4-6 bonuses with values

### Step 6: Choice of Yeses (@alan-weiss + @blair-enns)
**Create 3 escalating options:**

**Option 1: CORE (Base)**
- Core transformation
- Standard deliverables
- Price: R$15K-R$18K

**Option 2: ACCELERATED (Enhanced)** [includes Option 1 +]
- Faster implementation
- Additional 1:1 support
- Enhanced bonuses
- Price: R$20K-R$25K

**Option 3: PREMIUM (Comprehensive)** [includes Option 1 & 2 +]
- VIP access
- Done-with-you implementation
- Ongoing advisory (3-6 months)
- All bonuses + exclusive extras
- Price: R$30K-R$50K

**Psychology:** Most choose Option 2 or 3.

**Deliverable:** 3-tier pricing structure

### Step 7: StoryBrand Integration (@donald-miller)
**Frame offer using 7-part story:**
1. **Character:** Expert stuck in Excellence, revenue plateau
2. **Problem:** Can't articulate value, competing on price, no proprietary method
3. **Guide:** You (Robson) with proven pattern-to-method framework
4. **Plan:** 90-day codification → offer design → first clients
5. **Call to Action:** "Apply for 90-Day Method Acceleration"
6. **Success:** R$100K/month with method, 5 clients @ R$20K, genius zone daily
7. **Failure:** Stay in Excellence, trade time for money, never escape

**Deliverable:** Story-framed offer description
