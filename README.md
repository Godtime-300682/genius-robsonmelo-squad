## Key Principles

### Your Genius Zone (Stay Here)
✅ Investigating invisible patterns others can't see
✅ Codifying those patterns into frameworks
✅ Connecting people around ideas
✅ Creating methods that mobilize groups
✅ Closing strategic high-ticket clients

### Excellence Zone (Delegate)
❌ Analytical work for others' problems
❌ Implementing someone else's strategy
❌ Operations and delivery execution
❌ Administrative and repetitive tasks

### Upper Limit Problem (Watch For)
🚨 Taking analytical projects to stay busy (scarcity mindset)
🚨 Hesitating to send R$15K+ proposals (not deserving)
🚨 Starting new project before monetizing current IP (Creator trap)
🚨 Avoiding exposure that Genius requires (protection mechanism)

## Next Steps

1. **Activate orchestrator:** `@genius-robsonmelo`
2. **Start with:** Method codification or Grand Slam Offer creation
3. **Execute:** wf-90-day-acceleration workflow
4. **Measure:** Flow frequency (should increase from 1-3x/month to daily)
5. **Target:** R$100K/month with 5 clients @ R$20K each
