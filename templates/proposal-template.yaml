# 9-Part Proposal Template (Alan Weiss Structure)
# For high-ticket method offers (R$150K-R$350K)
# Template version: 1.0

metadata:
  template_name: "9-Part Value-Based Proposal"
  author: "Alan Weiss / genius-robsonmelo-squad"
  target_use: "High-ticket method offers"
  typical_length: "2-3 pages maximum"
  success_rate: "60-80% close rate when value conversation precedes proposal"

# =================================================================
# INSTRUCTIONS
# =================================================================
instructions: |
  1. Complete value conversation FIRST (use value-conversation-template.md)
  2. Populate this template with CLIENT'S language from that conversation
  3. Keep total length to 2-3 pages (not more!)
  4. Fees appear AFTER value is established (Part 5)
  5. Always offer "choice of yeses" (3 options minimum)
  6. Send as PDF + schedule follow-up call 3 days later

# =================================================================
# PART 1: SITUATION APPRAISAL (3 sentences max)
# =================================================================
part_1_situation_appraisal:
  title: "Current Situation"
  max_length: "3 sentences"
  guidance: "Summarize their current state, pain points, and opportunity"

  template: |
    {CLIENT_COMPANY} is currently {CURRENT_STATE}. The primary challenge
    is {PRIMARY_PAIN_POINT}, which is resulting in {NEGATIVE_CONSEQUENCE}.
    This represents an opportunity to {TRANSFORMATION_OPPORTUNITY}.

  example: |
    Acme Consulting is currently positioned as a generalist provider in
    a crowded marketplace. The primary challenge is the inability to
    articulate unique value, which results in price-based competition
    and commoditization. This represents an opportunity to transform
    pattern recognition into a proprietary method that commands
    premium positioning.

# =================================================================
# PART 2: OBJECTIVES (3-5 bullet points)
# =================================================================
part_2_objectives:
  title: "Objectives"
  format: "Bullet list"
  max_bullets: 5
  guidance: "What will change? Use measurable, observable outcomes from value conversation"

  template: |
    • {OBJECTIVE_1} - {MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_1}
    • {OBJECTIVE_2} - {MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_2}
    • {OBJECTIVE_3} - {MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_3}
    • {OBJECTIVE_4} - {MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_4} (optional)
    • {OBJECTIVE_5} - {MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_5} (optional)

  example: |
    • Codify proprietary method with unique name and documented framework
    • Create Grand Slam Offer priced at R$20K+ with clear differentiation
    • Position as expert (not vendor) through value-based conversations
    • Generate pipeline of 5 qualified opportunities within 90 days
    • Close first 3 clients at R$20K each to validate method and business model

# =================================================================
# PART 3: METRICS (How success will be measured)
# =================================================================
part_3_metrics:
  title: "Success Metrics"
  guidance: "Use KPIs THEY stated in value conversation"

  template: |
    Success will be measured by the following key performance indicators:

    QUANTITATIVE:
    • {METRIC_1}: Baseline {BASELINE_VALUE} → Target {TARGET_VALUE}
    • {METRIC_2}: Baseline {BASELINE_VALUE} → Target {TARGET_VALUE}
    • {METRIC_3}: Baseline {BASELINE_VALUE} → Target {TARGET_VALUE}

    QUALITATIVE:
    • {QUAL_METRIC_1}: {BEFORE_STATE} → {AFTER_STATE}
    • {QUAL_METRIC_2}: {BEFORE_STATE} → {AFTER_STATE}

    ROI CALCULATION:
    • Value created: {TOTAL_VALUE}
    • Investment: {FEE_AMOUNT}
    • ROI: {ROI_MULTIPLE}:1

  example: |
    Success will be measured by the following key performance indicators:

    QUANTITATIVE:
    • Revenue per client: Baseline R$8K → Target R$20K (150% increase)
    • Monthly revenue: Baseline R$32K → Target R$100K (213% increase)
    • Proposals sent: Baseline 2/month → Target 5/month (150% increase)

    QUALITATIVE:
    • Positioning: Commodity consultant → Recognized method creator
    • Confidence: Hesitant pricing → Bold R$20K+ proposals

    ROI CALCULATION:
    • Value created: R$816K annually (R$68K/month increase × 12)
    • Investment: R$200K
    • ROI: 4:1 first year, 10:1+ over 3 years

# =================================================================
# PART 4: VALUE (Impact in client's terms)
# =================================================================
part_4_value:
  title: "Value & Impact"
  critical: "THIS COMES BEFORE FEES - Client must see value first"
  guidance: "Use value calculation from value conversation"

  template: |
    The transformation we've outlined will create the following value for
    {CLIENT_COMPANY}:

    TANGIBLE OUTCOMES ({TIMEFRAME}):
    • {TANGIBLE_1}: {VALUE_AMOUNT}
    • {TANGIBLE_2}: {VALUE_AMOUNT}
    • {TANGIBLE_3}: {VALUE_AMOUNT}
    Subtotal tangible: {TANGIBLE_TOTAL}

    INTANGIBLE OUTCOMES:
    • {INTANGIBLE_1}: {EQUIVALENT_VALUE}
    • {INTANGIBLE_2}: {EQUIVALENT_VALUE}
    Subtotal intangible: {INTANGIBLE_TOTAL}

    PERIPHERAL BENEFITS:
    • {PERIPHERAL_1}: {VALUE}
    • {PERIPHERAL_2}: {VALUE}
    Subtotal peripheral: {PERIPHERAL_TOTAL}

    TOTAL VALUE CREATED: {TOTAL_VALUE}

    This represents {ROI_DESCRIPTION} for {CLIENT_COMPANY}.

  example: |
    The transformation we've outlined will create the following value for
    Acme Consulting:

    TANGIBLE OUTCOMES (12 months):
    • Revenue increase (5 clients @ R$20K vs. current R$8K): R$720K
    • Time saved (systematized delivery): R$60K equivalent
    • Reduced client acquisition cost: R$36K
    Subtotal tangible: R$816K

    INTANGIBLE OUTCOMES:
    • Market positioning as method creator: R$150K equivalent
    • Team confidence and morale improvement: R$50K equivalent
    Subtotal intangible: R$200K

    PERIPHERAL BENEFITS:
    • Repeatable sales process (future value): R$100K
    • Referral network activation: R$80K
    Subtotal peripheral: R$180K

    TOTAL VALUE CREATED: R$1,196,000 over 12 months

    This represents a minimum 6:1 ROI in year one, with compounding
    value in subsequent years as the method scales.

# =================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# =================================================================
usage_notes: |
  CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
  1. Complete value conversation FIRST - never send cold
  2. Use CLIENT'S language from value conversation (not your assumptions)
  3. Keep to 2-3 pages (delete this YAML comments section when creating PDF)
  4. Value (Part 4) comes BEFORE fees (Part 5) - ALWAYS
  5. Offer choice of yeses (3 options minimum)
  6. Schedule follow-up call 3 days after sending
  7. Don't negotiate Option 1 price down - offer payment plans instead

  CLOSE RATE EXPECTATIONS:
  • After value conversation: 60-80%
  • Cold send (no conversation): 10-20%
  • With case study/testimonial: 75-85%

  COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
  • Sending before value conversation (plummets close rate)
  • Making it too long (>3 pages loses attention)
  • Fees before value (triggers price objection)
  • Single option (no choice = pressure = resistance)
  • Generic language (use THEIR words from conversations)
