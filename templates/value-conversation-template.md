# Value Conversation Template
**The Art of Pricing Without Pitching**

Based on Blair Enns' Win Without Pitching methodology & Alan Weiss' value-based pricing framework

---

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

> **"He who mentions price first, loses."** — Blair Enns

> **"Never discuss fees until value is quantified."** — Alan Weiss

**The Value Conversation is Conversation #3 in Blair Enns' 4 Conversations:**
1. **Probative Conversation** - Diagnose if there's a fit
2. **Qualifying Conversation** - Determine if they can afford you & if you want to work together
3. **VALUE CONVERSATION** ← YOU ARE HERE
4. **Closing Conversation** - Present proposal & get decision

---

## PURPOSE OF THE VALUE CONVERSATION

**What this conversation IS:**
- A collaborative exploration of what success looks like
- A quantification of the financial and emotional impact of transformation
- The foundation for your proposal (you'll use THEIR language)
- A value anchoring exercise (so your fee seems small by comparison)

**What this conversation IS NOT:**
- A pitch (you're not selling, you're diagnosing)
- A free consulting session (you're asking questions, not giving solutions)
- A negotiation (you haven't presented fees yet)
- A capabilities presentation (they already know you're qualified)

**Success Metric:**
By the end of this conversation, the client should say: "Whatever this costs, it's worth it" BEFORE you mention your fee.

---

## PRE-CONVERSATION CHECKLIST

Before scheduling the Value Conversation, ensure:

- [ ] You've completed the Probative Conversation (diagnosed the problem)
- [ ] You've completed the Qualifying Conversation (they're qualified to buy)
- [ ] You have 60-90 minutes scheduled (minimum)
- [ ] Decision-maker(s) are attending (not delegated to junior staff)
- [ ] You've sent pre-work questions (see Pre-Work section below)
- [ ] You're in the right mindset: curious, not desperate
- [ ] You have your value calculation worksheet ready

## THE 4-STEP VALUE CONVERSATION FRAMEWORK

### STEP 1: DEFINE SUCCESS (What They Want)
**Goal:** Get them to paint the vivid picture of the desired future state

**Opening Script:**
> "Before we talk about how we'd work together or what this might cost, I need to understand what success looks like for you. If we're having this conversation again in [TIMEFRAME], and you're thrilled with the results, what has changed?"

**Follow-Up Questions:**
- "What specifically would be different in your business?"
- "How would your day-to-day feel different?"
- "What would you be able to do that you can't do now?"
- "What frustrations would be gone?"
- "How would your team be different?"
- "What would your clients say about you?"
- "What new opportunities would be available to you?"

**Emotional Layer Questions:**
- "How would that feel?"
- "What would that mean for you personally?"
- "What would achieving this allow you to do next?"
- "What's the bigger vision this unlocks?"

**Example Client Response:**
> "We'd have a proprietary method with our name on it. We'd be closing clients at R$20K instead of R$8K. I'd wake up excited instead of anxious about where the next client comes from. I'd finally feel like my expertise is valued, not commoditized."

**Your Job:**
- Listen actively, take notes
- Let them talk (80% them, 20% you)
- Ask "anything else?" until they're done
- Capture their EXACT language (you'll use it in the proposal)

---

### STEP 2: IDENTIFY METRICS (How Success is Measured)
**Goal:** Translate emotional desires into measurable KPIs

**Transition Script:**
> "That's a compelling vision. Now help me understand—how would we measure that we've achieved it? What are the key metrics that would tell us we're successful?"

**Quantitative Metric Questions:**
- "What's your current revenue? What would you want it to be?"
- "How many clients do you currently close per month? What's the target?"
- "What's your current average deal size? What should it be?"
- "How much time do you spend on [ACTIVITY]? How much would you like to spend?"
- "What's your current profit margin? What should it be?"
- "How many proposals do you send? How many should you send?"
- "What's your close rate now? What would great look like?"

**Qualitative Metric Questions:**
- "How would you describe your market positioning today vs. where you want to be?"
- "How confident are you in pricing conversations today (1-10)? Where should you be?"
- "How differentiated are you from competitors today vs. ideal state?"

**Baseline Documentation:**
For each metric, document:
- **Current State (Baseline):** [NUMBER]
- **Desired State (Target):** [NUMBER]
- **Gap:** [TARGET - BASELINE]
- **Timeframe:** [WHEN THEY EXPECT THIS]

**Example Metrics Table:**

| Metric | Baseline (Today) | Target (90 Days) | Gap |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-----|
| Average Deal Size | R$8,000 | R$20,000 | +R$12,000 |
| Monthly Revenue | R$32,000 | R$100,000 | +R$68,000 |
| Proposals Sent/Month | 2 | 5 | +3 |
| Close Rate | 40% | 60% | +20% |
| Positioning Confidence (1-10) | 4 | 9 | +5 |

---

### STEP 3: QUANTIFY VALUE (Financial Impact)
**Goal:** Calculate the dollar value of achieving those metrics

**Critical Mindset:**
This is THE most important step. You're building the anchor that makes your fee look tiny by comparison.

**Transition Script:**
> "Let's put some numbers to this. If we achieve these metrics, what's the financial impact on your business?"

#### 3A. TANGIBLE VALUE (Direct Financial Impact)

**Revenue Impact Questions:**
- "You said you want to go from R$8K to R$20K average deal size. If you close 5 clients per month at R$20K instead of your current 4 at R$8K, what's the revenue difference over 12 months?"
  - **Calculation:** (5 × R$20K × 12) - (4 × R$8K × 12) = R$1,200,000 - R$384,000 = **R$816,000 additional revenue**

- "What about the time you'll save? If you spend 20 hours/week on proposals and pitching today, and we reduce that to 8 hours/week, what's that time worth?"
  - **Calculation:** 12 hours/week × 48 weeks × R$500/hour (your consulting rate) = **R$288,000 time savings**

**Cost Reduction Questions:**
- "What are you spending on marketing/BD that's not working?"
- "What's the cost of your current client acquisition process?"
- "How much revenue do you leave on the table by underpricing?"

**Formula for Tangible Value:**
```
TANGIBLE VALUE =
  (Revenue Increase × Timeframe) +
  (Cost Savings × Timeframe) +
  (Time Savings × Hourly Rate × Timeframe) +
  (Margin Improvement × Current Revenue)
```

#### 3B. INTANGIBLE VALUE (Emotional/Strategic Impact)

**Positioning Value Questions:**
- "What's it worth to be recognized as THE authority in your niche instead of one of many consultants?"
- "If you could command premium pricing forever after this, what's that positioning worth over 3-5 years?"
- "What's the value of confidence—knowing you can send a R$20K proposal without hesitation?"

**Risk Avoidance Questions:**
- "What's the cost of continuing as-is for another year?"
- "What opportunities are you missing because you can't articulate your value?"
- "What's at stake if this problem doesn't get solved?"

**Assign Dollar Equivalents:**
Even for intangibles, assign conservative dollar values:
- Market positioning as recognized method creator: **R$150K equivalent over 3 years**
- Team confidence and morale improvement: **R$50K equivalent in productivity**
- Avoided opportunity cost (not solving this): **R$200K per year**

#### 3C. PERIPHERAL BENEFITS (Unexpected Wins)

**Questions:**
- "What else becomes possible once you have this solved?"
- "What second-order effects will this create?"
- "Who else benefits? (team, family, clients, partners)"

**Examples:**
- Repeatable sales process you can train others on: **R$100K future value**
- Referral network activation (recognized positioning): **R$80K**
- Content marketing assets (method becomes content): **R$40K value**

#### 3D. CALCULATE TOTAL VALUE

**Value Calculation Worksheet:**

```
TANGIBLE OUTCOMES (12 months):
• Revenue increase: R$816,000
• Time saved: R$288,000
• Cost reduction: R$36,000
-----------------------------------
Subtotal Tangible: R$1,140,000

INTANGIBLE OUTCOMES:
• Market positioning: R$150,000
• Confidence/morale: R$50,000
• Risk avoidance: R$200,000
-----------------------------------
Subtotal Intangible: R$400,000

PERIPHERAL BENEFITS:
• Repeatable process: R$100,000
• Referral activation: R$80,000
• Content assets: R$40,000
-----------------------------------
Subtotal Peripheral: R$220,000

TOTAL VALUE CREATED: R$1,760,000
```

**The Anchor Question:**
> "So if I'm hearing you correctly, achieving these metrics would create approximately R$1.76 million in value over the next 12 months. Is that a fair assessment, or am I missing anything?"

**Their response should be:**
> "Yes, that's conservative. It could be even more."

**If they push back on the numbers:**
- Don't argue, adjust downward conservatively
- Even at 50% of your calculation, the value is massive
- What matters: they agree there's significant value

---

### STEP 4: ESTABLISH INVESTMENT RANGE (Their Budget Reality)

**Goal:** Understand what they're prepared to invest WITHOUT revealing your price

**Critical Rule:**
DO NOT mention your price in this conversation. You're simply understanding if you're in the same ballpark.

**Transition Script:**
> "We've established that this transformation would create around R$1.76 million in value. Now I need to understand—given that level of impact, what would be a reasonable investment for you?"

#### 4A. THE INVESTMENT RANGE QUESTION

**Direct Approach (if they're sophisticated):**
> "For a transformation that creates R$1.76M in value, what range of investment makes sense to you? What would feel too cheap to deliver real results, and what would feel too expensive?"

**Sandwich Approach (if they need more structure):**
> "Typically, for transformations at this level, clients invest anywhere from R$50K to R$500K depending on scope. Given what we've discussed, where in that range would you expect this to fall?"

**Ratio Approach (Alan Weiss style):**
> "Alan Weiss has a rule of thumb: a fair consulting fee delivers at least 10:1 ROI. Given R$1.76M in value, that would suggest an investment range of R$150K-R$250K. Does that feel aligned with your thinking?"

#### 4B. HANDLING THEIR RESPONSE

**If they say a number HIGHER than your planned fee:**
- Celebrate internally (don't show it)
- Take notes
- Say: "That's helpful context. Let me put together options for you."

**If they say a number LOWER than your planned fee:**
- Don't panic
- Ask: "Help me understand—what's driving that number?"
- Listen for: budget constraints vs. value skepticism
- If value skepticism: revisit Step 3, recalculate together
- If genuine budget constraint: "I appreciate the candor. Let me see what's possible. I'll present a few options—some may be outside this range, but I'll show the ROI for each."

**If they say "I don't know":**
> "I understand. Let me ask it differently: we've established R$1.76M in value. What percentage of that value would feel like a fair investment to achieve it? 5%? 10%? 20%?"
- 5% = R$88K
- 10% = R$176K
- 20% = R$352K

**If they say "What do you usually charge?":**
> "It depends entirely on the value created, which is why we went through this exercise. Based on what you've shared, I'll put together a proposal with a few options at different price points. You'll be able to choose what makes sense for you."

#### 4C. THE BUDGET REALITY CHECK

Before ending, confirm their ability to invest:

> "One last question: if the proposal shows a clear 10:1 ROI or better, and you love the approach, is there anything that would prevent you from moving forward? Budget approvals, timing constraints, other priorities?"

**Listen for red flags:**
- "I need to talk to my partner" (they're not the decision-maker—you failed qualifying conversation)
- "We're not sure about timing" (not urgent—low close probability)
- "We're talking to other firms" (you're in a bake-off—danger zone)

**If red flags emerge:**
> "It sounds like there might be some other considerations we should discuss before I invest time in a detailed proposal. Should we address those now?"

---

## CONVERSATION CLOSE

**Summary Script:**
> "This has been incredibly valuable. Let me summarize what I heard:
>
> **SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:** [repeat their vision in their words]
>
> **KEY METRICS:** [list the 3-5 most important KPIs]
>
> **VALUE CREATED:** Approximately R$1.76M over 12 months, broken down as [brief summary]
>
> **INVESTMENT RANGE:** You indicated that [their range] feels appropriate for this level of transformation.
>
> Does that accurately capture our conversation?"

**Next Steps Script:**
> "Here's what happens next:
>
> 1. I'll create a detailed proposal with 3 options at different investment levels
> 2. Each option will show exactly what's included and the ROI
> 3. I'll send it to you by [DATE - typically 3-5 days]
> 4. We'll schedule a follow-up call for [DATE - 3 days after sending] to discuss and answer questions
> 5. If you love it and the numbers work, we can start as soon as [DATE]
>
> Sound good?"

**Confirmation Questions:**
- "Any questions before we wrap up?"
- "Is there anything we didn't cover that I should know?"
- "Are you comfortable with this process?"

**The Commitment Close:**
> "One final question: based on everything we've discussed, if I come back with a proposal that delivers 10:1 ROI and you're confident in the approach, is there any reason you wouldn't move forward?"

*If they say "No reason"—you have a soft commitment.*
*If they raise an objection—handle it now, not later.*

## COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### Objection 1: "Can't you just give me a ballpark now?"

**Why they ask:** They want control, want to filter you out early, or are price shopping.

**Response:**
> "I could, but I'd be guessing—and I don't want to guess with your business. Every situation is different. Based on what you've shared, I'll put together options that show you exactly what you get and the ROI. Fair enough?"

**Alternative (if they push):**
> "Typically, transformations at this scale range from R$150K to R$350K depending on scope and support level. But let's finish this conversation so I can give you an accurate proposal rather than a guess."

---

### Objection 2: "That seems like a lot of value. I'm skeptical."

**Why they say this:** They don't believe the numbers, or you haven't made it concrete enough.

**Response:**
> "I appreciate the healthy skepticism. Let's go back through the math together. Which number feels inflated to you—the revenue increase, the time savings, or something else?"

**Then:**
- Recalculate together, conservatively
- Cut the numbers in half if needed
- Even at 50% of your calculation, your fee still delivers 5:1+ ROI

---

### Objection 3: "We need to think about it."

**Why they say this:** Lack of urgency, fear of commitment, or hidden decision-maker.

**Response:**
> "Absolutely, this is an important decision. Help me understand—what specifically do you need to think about? The approach, the timing, the investment level, or something else?"

**Then:**
- Address the real concern (it's never "thinking")
- If it's budget: discuss payment plans
- If it's approach: clarify methodology
- If it's timing: understand why "not now"

---

### Objection 4: "Can you work for a lower fee?"

**Why they ask:** Testing you, genuine budget constraint, or don't see the value.

**Response (if they don't see value):**
> "It sounds like I haven't made the ROI clear. Let's revisit: we calculated R$1.76M in value. Even if I'm off by 50%, that's R$880K. I'm proposing R$200K. That's still 4:1 ROI. What am I missing?"

**Response (if genuine budget constraint):**
> "I understand budget constraints. A few options:
> 1. I can show you a reduced scope option that fits your budget
> 2. We can structure payment over time (50% now, 50% at milestone)
> 3. We can phase the work (start with Phase 1, add Phase 2 later)
>
> Which would work best?"

**NEVER:**
- Discount your fee out of desperation
- Lower your price without reducing scope
- Negotiate against yourself

---

### Objection 5: "We're talking to other firms."

**Why they say this:** You're in a bake-off (procurement mode), or they're negotiating.

**Response:**
> "I appreciate you being upfront. I should mention—I don't compete in bake-offs or beauty pageants. My process is collaborative, not competitive.
>
> If you're genuinely exploring the best fit for this transformation, I'm happy to continue. But if you're looking for the lowest price among similar options, I'm probably not the right choice.
>
> Which is this?"

**If they're price shopping:**
- Politely decline: "I think you'd be better served by [competitor]. They're a great firm and may be a better fit for this process."

**If they're genuinely exploring:**
- Continue, but qualify harder
- Ask: "What criteria are you using to decide?"
- Position on value, not price

## PRICING DECISION MATRIX

After the Value Conversation, use this to decide your fee:

| Total Value | 10:1 ROI Fee | 5:1 ROI Fee | 3:1 ROI Fee | Recommendation |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| R$500K | R$50K | R$100K | R$167K | Offer R$100K-R$150K (conservative) |
| R$1M | R$100K | R$200K | R$333K | Offer R$150K-R$250K (confident) |
| R$1.5M | R$150K | R$300K | R$500K | Offer R$200K-R$350K (bold) |
| R$2M+ | R$200K | R$400K | R$667K | Offer R$250K-R$500K (premium) |

**General Rule:**
- Aim for 5-10:1 ROI (conservative to confident)
- Never go below 3:1 ROI (client won't see value)
- If they indicated higher range than your calculation, use their range
- Always offer 3 options (choice of yeses)

---

## MINDSET & PSYCHOLOGY

### Before the Call

**Abundance Mindset:**
> "I don't need this client. I'm here to see if we're a fit. If we're not, that's fine—I'll find the right clients."

**Consultative Mindset:**
> "I'm a doctor diagnosing a patient, not a vendor pitching a product."

**Value-First Mindset:**
> "My job is to quantify value, not to justify my fee."

### During the Call

**Slow Down:**
- Don't rush through the questions
- Let silence work for you (they'll fill it with valuable info)
- Take notes (it shows you care)

**Be Genuinely Curious:**
- This isn't a script, it's a conversation
- Follow interesting threads
- Ask "tell me more about that" frequently

**Don't Solve Yet:**
- Resist the urge to jump into solutions
- You're diagnosing, not prescribing (yet)
- Save the "how" for the proposal

### After the Call

**Don't Discount:**
- If you calculated R$1.76M in value and they said R$150K range, don't drop your fee to R$120K
- Offer options, but don't negotiate against yourself

**Trust the Process:**
- If you did the value conversation right, your close rate should be 60-80%
- If it's lower, revisit your value quantification step

---

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

You NAILED the Value Conversation if:

✅ The client said "this is exactly what we need" during the call
✅ You have a clear dollar value for the transformation that THEY agreed to
✅ They gave you a budget range (and didn't say "send me a proposal and we'll see")
✅ You captured their exact language for the proposal
✅ They expressed urgency ("we need this done by...")
✅ They asked "when can we start?" before you even sent the proposal
✅ You feel confident they'll close (gut check)

You FAILED the Value Conversation if:

❌ You couldn't quantify value in dollars (only talked in vague terms)
❌ They were evasive about budget
❌ You didn't get emotional commitment (just logical agreement)
❌ They said "send me something and we'll think about it"
❌ You're unclear who the real decision-maker is
❌ You feel like you're chasing them

---

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SQUAD TEMPLATES

**BEFORE Value Conversation:**
- Use **Probative Conversation** (Blair Enns) to diagnose fit
- Use **Qualifying Conversation** (Blair Enns) to ensure they can afford you

**AFTER Value Conversation:**
- Use **proposal-template.yaml** to create 9-part proposal
  - Part 1 (Situation Appraisal): Use their exact language from Step 1
  - Part 2 (Objectives): Use metrics from Step 2
  - Part 3 (Metrics): Use KPIs from Step 2
  - Part 4 (Value): Use calculations from Step 3
  - Part 5 (Options): Use investment range from Step 4 to price options

- Use **brandscript-template.yaml** for messaging consistency
  - Character = their role (from Step 1)
  - Problem = what they're trying to solve (from Step 1)
  - Success = vision (from Step 1)

---

## EXAMPLE: COMPLETE VALUE CONVERSATION

**Context:** Expert consultant wants to productize their expertise

---

**YOU:** "Thanks for making time today. Before we talk about how we'd work together or what this might cost, I need to understand what success looks like for you. If we're having this conversation again in 90 days and you're thrilled with the results, what has changed?"

**CLIENT:** "I'd have a method—something with my name on it that I can sell. Right now, every client engagement feels custom, and I'm always competing on price. I want to be able to say 'here's my method, here's the price, take it or leave it.'"

**YOU:** "What specifically would be different in your business?"

**CLIENT:** "I'd be closing clients at R$20K instead of R$8K. I'd stop doing free pitches. I'd have a repeatable process so I'm not reinventing the wheel every time."

**YOU:** "How would your day-to-day feel different?"

**CLIENT:** "I'd wake up excited instead of anxious. Right now I'm constantly worried about where the next client comes from. With a method, I'd have a system—marketing, sales, delivery, all of it."

**YOU:** "What would that mean for you personally?"

**CLIENT:** "Freedom. I could take a vacation without worrying the business would fall apart. I could hire someone to help. I'd finally feel like I'm building something that could outlive me."

**YOU:** *(Pauses, takes notes)* "That's powerful. Anything else?"

**CLIENT:** "Yeah—respect. Right now, clients treat me like a vendor. I want to be the recognized expert."

---

**YOU:** "That's a compelling vision. Now help me understand—how would we measure that we've achieved it? What are the key metrics?"

**CLIENT:** "Revenue is the obvious one. I'm at about R$32K a month now, I want to get to R$100K."

**YOU:** "Got it. What else?"

**CLIENT:** "Average deal size—R$8K to R$20K. And I want to close deals faster. Right now it takes 6-8 weeks from first conversation to signed contract. I'd like that down to 2-3 weeks."

**YOU:** "How many proposals are you sending per month now?"

**CLIENT:** "Maybe 2. I'd like to send 5."

**YOU:** "And what's your close rate?"

**CLIENT:** "About 40%. I'd love to get that to 60%."

**YOU:** *(Documents metrics)* "So just to summarize:
- Monthly revenue: R$32K → R$100K
- Average deal size: R$8K → R$20K
- Proposals per month: 2 → 5
- Close rate: 40% → 60%
- Sales cycle: 6-8 weeks → 2-3 weeks

Does that capture it?"

**CLIENT:** "Yes, exactly."

---

**YOU:** "Perfect. Now let's put some numbers to this. If we achieve these metrics, what's the financial impact on your business?"

**CLIENT:** "Well, R$100K a month is R$1.2M a year. I'm at about R$384K now, so that's... R$816K increase."

**YOU:** "Right. And that's just the direct revenue increase. What about the time you'll save?"

**CLIENT:** "What do you mean?"

**YOU:** "You mentioned you'd stop doing free pitches and have a repeatable process. How much time do you spend on pitching and custom proposals right now?"

**CLIENT:** "Probably 20 hours a week."

**YOU:** "And with a systemized method?"

**CLIENT:** "Maybe 8 hours a week?"

**YOU:** "So 12 hours a week saved. That's 576 hours a year. What's that time worth to you—what do you bill at?"

**CLIENT:** "R$500 an hour."

**YOU:** "So that's R$288K in time savings. What could you do with that time?"

**CLIENT:** "Deliver to more clients, or actually take time off."

**YOU:** *(Calculating on worksheet)* "So we're at R$816K revenue increase plus R$288K time savings. That's R$1.1M in tangible value. What about the intangible stuff—positioning, confidence, peace of mind?"

**CLIENT:** "That's hard to quantify."

**YOU:** "Let me ask it this way: what's it worth to be THE recognized authority in your niche instead of one of many consultants?"

**CLIENT:** "A lot. I mean, once you have that positioning, you can charge premium prices forever."

**YOU:** "Over the next 3 years, conservatively, what's that worth?"

**CLIENT:** "I don't know... R$150K? Maybe more?"

**YOU:** "Fair. What about the confidence piece—knowing you can send a R$20K proposal without hesitation?"

**CLIENT:** "That's probably worth R$50K just in not leaving money on the table."

**YOU:** *(Still calculating)* "And what becomes possible once you have this solved? What's the second-order effect?"

**CLIENT:** "I could train someone else to deliver the method. I could build a team. Maybe even franchise it."

**YOU:** "Conservatively, what's that repeatable process worth over time?"

**CLIENT:** "R$100K at least."

**YOU:** *(Shows calculation)* "So here's what I'm hearing:
- Tangible: R$1.1M
- Intangible: R$200K (positioning + confidence)
- Peripheral: R$100K (scalability)
- Total: R$1.4M in value over 12 months

Is that fair, or am I missing anything?"

**CLIENT:** *(Pauses)* "No, that's actually conservative. It could be more."

**YOU:** "Great. So we've established around R$1.4M in value."

---

**YOU:** "Now I need to understand—given that level of impact, what would be a reasonable investment for you?"

**CLIENT:** *(Pauses, thinking)* "I don't know... what do you usually charge?"

**YOU:** "It depends entirely on the value created, which is why we went through this exercise. But let me ask it this way: we've established R$1.4M in value. What percentage of that value would feel like a fair investment to achieve it?"

**CLIENT:** "I guess... 10-15%?"

**YOU:** "So that's R$140K to R$210K. Does that feel aligned with your thinking?"

**CLIENT:** "Yeah, I mean, if the ROI is there, that makes sense."

**YOU:** "One last question: if the proposal shows a clear 10:1 ROI or better, and you love the approach, is there anything that would prevent you from moving forward?"

**CLIENT:** "No, I'm ready. I've been stuck here too long."

---

**YOU:** "This has been incredibly valuable. Let me summarize:

**Success looks like:** A proprietary method with your name on it, closing clients at R$20K, repeatable processes, and being recognized as THE expert—not a commodity.

**Key metrics:** R$100K/month revenue, R$20K average deal size, 60% close rate, 2-3 week sales cycle.

**Value created:** Approximately R$1.4M over 12 months in revenue increases, time savings, positioning, and scalability.

**Investment range:** You indicated R$140K-R$210K feels appropriate.

Does that accurately capture our conversation?"

**CLIENT:** "Yes, exactly."

**YOU:** "Here's what happens next:
1. I'll create a detailed proposal with 3 options
2. Each will show deliverables, timeline, and ROI
3. I'll send it by Friday
4. We'll schedule a call for Monday to review
5. If you love it, we can start the following week.

Sound good?"

**CLIENT:** "Perfect. Looking forward to it."

## FINAL NOTES

**This conversation is the FOUNDATION of your entire engagement.**

If you do it right:
- Your proposal will practically write itself (you'll use their exact words)
- Your fee will feel small compared to the value (R$200K fee vs. R$1.4M value = easy yes)
- Your close rate will be 60-80% (vs. 20-30% for proposals sent without this conversation)

If you skip it:
- You'll be guessing at what they want
- They'll fixate on your fee (no value anchor)
- Your close rate will plummet

**The Value Conversation is NOT optional.**
