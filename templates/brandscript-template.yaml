# BrandScript Template (Donald Miller / StoryBrand 7-Part Framework)
# For clarifying brand message so customers can't ignore you
# Template version: 1.0

metadata:
  template_name: "StoryBrand BrandScript"
  author: "Donald Miller / genius-robsonmelo-squad"
  based_on: "Building a StoryBrand (Donald Miller, 2017)"
  target_use: "Website copy, pitch decks, elevator pitches, all marketing"
  principle: "Make the customer the hero, not your brand"

# =================================================================
# CORE PRINCIPLE
# =================================================================
core_principle: |
  YOUR BRAND IS THE GUIDE (like Yoda), not the hero.
  YOUR CUSTOMER IS THE HERO (like Luke Skywalker).

  Every great story has:
  1. A character (customer) who wants something
  2. Encounters a problem
  3. Meets a guide (your brand) who has a plan
  4. And calls them to action
  5. That results in success
  6. And helps them avoid failure

  If you confuse, you lose. Clarity wins.

# =================================================================
# PART 1: CHARACTER (Who is your customer?)
# =================================================================
part_1_character:
  title: "A CHARACTER"
  question: "Who is your customer & what do they want?"
  guidance: "Be specific. One person, one desire."
  critical: "They want something SPECIFIC, not vague"

  template:
    customer_description: "{WHO THEY ARE}"
    what_they_want: "{ONE SPECIFIC THING}"
    survival_need: "{WHICH SURVIVAL NEED DOES THIS RELATE TO?}"

  survival_needs:
    - "Conserve resources (time, money, energy)"
    - "Build networks (relationships, tribe)"
    - "Gain status (respect, authority, positioning)"
    - "Accumulate resources (money, assets)"
    - "Make meaning (purpose, legacy)"

  example:
    customer_description: "Expert consultant with valuable insights"
    what_they_want: "To transform their invisible pattern recognition into a proprietary method that commands premium fees"
    survival_need: "Gain status (recognized authority) + Accumulate resources (R$20K+ per client)"

  bad_examples:
    - "Everyone who needs consulting" (too broad)
    - "To be successful" (too vague)
    - "To grow their business" (too generic)

  good_examples:
    - "First-time home buyers who want to avoid costly mistakes"
    - "Overwhelmed entrepreneurs who want to systemize their operations"
    - "Experts who want to package their insights as high-ticket methods"

# =================================================================
# PART 2: HAS A PROBLEM
# =================================================================
part_2_problem:
  title: "HAS A PROBLEM"
  question: "What 3-level problem does the character face?"
  structure: "External → Internal → Philosophical (all 3 required)"
  critical: "Most brands only address external. You must address all 3."

  external_problem:
    definition: "The tangible, observable problem"
    question: "What physical obstacle do they face?"
    template: "{WHAT'S NOT WORKING IN THEIR WORLD}"
    example: "Competing on price, no differentiation from competitors, proposals get shopped"

  internal_problem:
    definition: "The frustration or doubt the external problem causes"
    question: "How does the external problem make them feel?"
    template: "They feel {EMOTION} because {REASON}"
    example: "They feel frustrated and undervalued because their deep expertise is commoditized"

  philosophical_problem:
    definition: "The 'why this is wrong' bigger issue"
    question: "What's the injustice? What 'should' be true?"
    template: "{WHAT SHOULD BE TRUE} but {WHAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE}"
    example: "True expertise should command premium compensation, but the market treats all consultants as interchangeable"

  bad_examples:
    - "They need better marketing" (too shallow, only external)
    - "They're not making enough money" (symptom, not root problem)

  good_examples:
    external: "Sales funnel isn't converting"
    internal: "Feel like they're bad at sales, losing confidence"
    philosophical: "Their hard work should pay off, but the system seems rigged"

# =================================================================
# PART 3: AND MEETS A GUIDE
# =================================================================
part_3_guide:
  title: "AND MEETS A GUIDE"
  question: "Why should they trust you? (Empathy + Authority)"
  structure: "Empathy first, then authority"
  critical: "Guide doesn't steal the show - helps hero win"

  empathy:
    definition: "You understand their problem"
    question: "How do you show you get it?"
    template: "I understand {THEIR PROBLEM}..."
    examples:
      - "I understand how frustrating it is to have valuable insights but no way to articulate them"
      - "I know what it's like to compete on price when you know you're worth more"
      - "I've seen brilliant consultants stay stuck because they can't package their genius"

  authority:
    definition: "You have successfully solved this before"
    question: "What proof do you have?"
    elements:
      - "Testimonials (social proof)"
      - "Statistics (X clients, Y results)"
      - "Awards or credentials"
      - "Case studies"
      - "Years of experience"
    template: "I've helped {NUMBER} {WHO} achieve {RESULT}"
    examples:
      - "I've helped 47 consultants transform their expertise into R$20K+ methods"
      - "My clients close 5x more deals after repositioning as method creators"
      - "Creator of The Pattern Codification Framework™ (used by 200+ experts)"

  your_brandscript:
    empathy: "{YOUR EMPATHY STATEMENT}"
    authority: "{YOUR AUTHORITY PROOF}"

  example:
    empathy: "I understand the frustration of having breakthrough insights that clients can't understand or value. I've been there—knowing you see patterns others miss but struggling to articulate that value in a way that justifies premium pricing."
    authority: "I created The Method Codification Framework™ after studying 50+ elite minds who successfully productized their expertise. My clients consistently achieve 3-5x pricing increases within 90 days of implementing this system."

# =================================================================
# PART 4: WHO GIVES THEM A PLAN
# =================================================================
part_4_plan:
  title: "WHO GIVES THEM A PLAN"
  question: "What's the simple 3-step process?"
  principle: "Customers need clarity on how to do business with you"
  structure: "3 steps maximum (or 4 if absolutely necessary)"
  critical: "Make it dead simple. Confusion = lost sale."

  types_of_plans:
    process_plan:
      definition: "Steps to work with you"
      example: "1. Book discovery call, 2. Get custom plan, 3. Transform your method"

    agreement_plan:
      definition: "Commitments that ease fears"
      example: "1. No free pitching, 2. Value-based pricing, 3. Guaranteed results"

  template:
    step_1: "{EASY FIRST STEP}"
    step_2: "{VALUABLE MIDDLE STEP}"
    step_3: "{TRANSFORMATION ACHIEVED}"

  example_process_plan:
    step_1: "Identify Your Pattern - We discover the invisible insight you see"
    step_2: "Codify Your Method - We transform it into a proprietary framework"
    step_3: "Land Your Clients - We help you close R$20K+ deals using your method"

  example_agreement_plan:
    step_1: "No Free Work - We never pitch or give away thinking"
    step_2: "Value-Based Pricing - You'll charge what you're worth, not hours"
    step_3: "Guaranteed Results - If you don't have a method by Day 90, full refund"

  your_plan:
    step_1: "{YOUR STEP 1}"
    step_2: "{YOUR STEP 2}"
    step_3: "{YOUR STEP 3}"

  bad_examples:
    - "We do a bunch of stuff and then magic happens" (too vague)
    - "1. Discovery, 2. Analysis, 3. Strategy, 4. Implementation, 5. Optimization" (too many steps)

# =================================================================
# PART 5: AND CALLS THEM TO ACTION
# =================================================================
part_5_call_to_action:
  title: "AND CALLS THEM TO ACTION"
  question: "What are your direct and transitional CTAs?"
  structure: "2 CTAs required: Direct (buy now) + Transitional (learn more)"
  critical: "If you don't ask, they won't act. Be bold."

  direct_cta:
    definition: "The buy now / let's go / commit action"
    principle: "Should appear multiple times on website/materials"
    examples:
      - "Apply for 90-Day Method Acceleration"
      - "Book Your Strategy Session"
      - "Start Your Transformation Today"
      - "Reserve Your Spot (Limited to 5 clients)"
    your_direct_cta: "{YOUR DIRECT CTA}"

  transitional_cta:
    definition: "The low-commitment first step for those not ready to buy"
    purpose: "Enter funnel, build trust, nurture relationship"
    types:
      - "Free PDF download"
      - "Webinar registration"
      - "Email course signup"
      - "Assessment/quiz"
      - "Free consultation"
    examples:
      - "Download: The Method Codification Checklist"
      - "Take the Quiz: Is Your Expertise Method-Ready?"
      - "Watch: How to Price Your Invisible Insights"
      - "Get: 5 Patterns That Command Premium Fees (Free Guide)"
    your_transitional_cta: "{YOUR TRANSITIONAL CTA}"

  placement:
    direct_cta:
      - "Hero section of website"
      - "End of pitch deck"
      - "End of email sequence"
      - "Footer of every page"
    transitional_cta:
      - "Popup on website"
      - "Sidebar of blog posts"
      - "Social media bio link"
      - "Email signature"

  example:
    direct_cta: "Apply for Method Acceleration Program"
    transitional_cta: "Download: The 3-Question Method Readiness Assessment"

# =================================================================
# PART 6: THAT HELPS THEM AVOID FAILURE
# =================================================================
part_6_failure:
  title: "THAT HELPS THEM AVOID FAILURE"
  question: "What's at stake? What happens if they don't act?"
  principle: "Loss aversion is 2x stronger than gain motivation"
  critical: "Don't overdo it. Tasteful stakes, not fear-mongering."
  frequency: "Mention 2-3 times max (hero, early web copy, email #3)"

  template:
    specific_failure: "{WHAT BAD THING HAPPENS}"
    broader_consequence: "{BIGGER IMPLICATION}"
    emotional_cost: "{HOW IT FEELS}"

  example:
    specific_failure: "Continue competing on price with no differentiation"
    broader_consequence: "Stuck in Excellence zone forever—busy but never wealthy"
    emotional_cost: "The frustration of knowing you're worth more but never proving it"

  bad_examples:
    - "You'll fail at everything" (too dramatic)
    - "You might not succeed" (too weak)
    - "Your competitors will win" (comparison, not stakes)

  good_examples:
    - "Your best insights will die with you, never packaged or monetized"
    - "You'll work harder for less money while lesser experts charge more"
    - "You'll retire without the legacy of a method that bears your name"

  your_failure:
    what_they_avoid: "{SPECIFIC FAILURE THEY AVOID}"

  usage_note: "Use sparingly. Mention in hero section, maybe one email, but don't hammer. Success (Part 7) is more important."

# =================================================================
# PART 7: AND ENDS IN SUCCESS
# =================================================================
part_7_success:
  title: "AND ENDS IN SUCCESS"
  question: "What does their life look like after working with you?"
  principle: "Paint the picture. Make them feel it."
  structure: "3 levels of success"
  critical: "This is your vision. Make it compelling."

  levels_of_success:
    level_1_external:
      definition: "Tangible, observable results"
      question: "What measurably changes?"
      example: "R$100K/month revenue from 5 clients @ R$20K each"

    level_2_internal:
      definition: "How they feel"
      question: "What emotional transformation?"
      example: "Confidence to send R$20K proposals without hesitation"

    level_3_status:
      definition: "How others see them"
      question: "What's their new identity/positioning?"
      example: "Recognized as the creator of [METHOD NAME]™, not a commodity consultant"

  template:
    external_success: "{TANGIBLE RESULTS}"
    internal_success: "{HOW THEY FEEL}"
    status_success: "{HOW THEY'RE SEEN}"

  example:
    external_success: |
      You have a proprietary method with your name on it, documented and
      ready to sell. You're closing R$20K+ clients consistently. Your
      calendar has 5 active transformations running simultaneously. You've
      achieved R$100K/month doing work that energizes you.

    internal_success: |
      You wake up in flow state daily, not 1-3x/month. No more analytical
      work for others that drains you. You feel confident, valued, and
      finally compensated for your true genius. The Upper Limit Problem
      no longer controls you.

    status_success: |
      You're known as THE creator of [METHOD NAME]. When people in your
      niche have this problem, they think of YOU first. You're no longer
      one of many consultants—you're the recognized authority with the
      only documented solution.

  your_success:
    what_they_achieve: "{THEIR SUCCESS STATE}"

  bad_examples:
    - "You'll be successful" (too vague)
    - "You'll make money" (only external, no emotion/status)

  good_examples:
    - "You'll have a method that outlives you, creating a legacy"
    - "Your genius finally matches your income—R$20K per client, every time"
    - "You're the go-to expert, not a commodity competing on price"

# =================================================================
# PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: ONE-LINER
# =================================================================
one_liner:
  definition: "Complete BrandScript in 1 sentence"
  formula: "We help {CHARACTER} solve {PROBLEM} so they can {SUCCESS}"
  usage: "Everywhere - LinkedIn bio, business cards, elevator pitch, intro"

  template: "We help {CHARACTER} overcome {PROBLEM} so they can {SUCCESS}."

# BRANDSCRIPT CHECKLIST
# =================================================================
checklist:
  - question: "Is my customer the hero (not me)?"
    pass: "Customer is Luke, I'm Yoda"
    fail: "I'm talking about how great I am"

  - question: "Did I address all 3 problem levels?"
    pass: "External, internal, AND philosophical"
    fail: "Only external problem mentioned"

  - question: "Is my plan 3 steps or fewer?"
    pass: "3 clear, simple steps"
    fail: "5+ steps or vague process"

  - question: "Do I have both CTAs?"
    pass: "Direct (buy) + transitional (learn more)"
    fail: "No CTA or only one type"

  - question: "Is success painted vividly?"
    pass: "Can see, feel, and imagine the transformation"
    fail: "Generic 'you'll be successful'"

  - question: "Did I clarify (not confuse)?"
    pass: "10-year-old could understand"
    fail: "Industry jargon, complex language"

# =================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# =================================================================
usage_notes: |
  CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:
  1. Customer = Hero. You = Guide. Never reverse this.
  2. Clarity over cleverness. Simple over sophisticated.
  3. If you confuse, you lose. Test on someone unfamiliar with your work.
  4. Address all 3 problem levels (most brands miss internal + philosophical)
  5. Call to action BOLDLY. Don't be shy. Ask for the sale.

  WHERE TO USE BRANDSCRIPT:
  • Website homepage (entire structure)
  • Pitch deck (slides mirror 7 parts)
  • Sales emails (one email per part)
  • LinkedIn About section (condensed)
  • Elevator pitch (one-liner formula)
  • Proposal intro (situation appraisal)

  COMMON MISTAKES:
  • Making yourself the hero (customer is hero!)
  • Only addressing external problem
  • No clear call to action
  • Too many steps in plan (>3 is too many)
  • Vague success (paint the picture!)

  SUCCESS INDICATORS:
  • Someone unfamiliar can explain what you do after reading once
  • You can pitch confidently using the one-liner
  • Website bounce rate decreases
  • More inquiries asking specifically about your method
