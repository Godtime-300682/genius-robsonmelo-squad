# A. LINKEDIN STRATEGY

## 3 Posts Per Week (Ready-to-Copy)

### POST 1 (TUESDAY) - Pattern Recognition Hook

**Copy:**
```
I see a pattern most experts miss.

You have a method that works. Clients always ask you to do it again.

But you don't have a name for it.
So you can't scale it.
So you can't charge R$20K for it.

You charge R$5K instead.

The irony:
- R$5K × 20 clients = R$100K (torture)
- R$20K × 5 clients = R$100K (flow)

Your method is the difference.

This week I'm helping experts turn their invisible method into proprietary Method™.

Quiz is free. Takes 5 min. Shows you where you stand.

Curious? Link in first comment 👇
```

**Post Format:**
1. Paste text above
2. Add [QUIZ LINK] in first comment
3. Publish
4. Boost (optional): R$50 budget, target your ideal client ICP

**Expected engagement:**
- Impressions: 500-1,000
- Clicks: 20-50
- Quiz starts: 5-10

---

### POST 2 (THURSDAY) - Case Study Hook

**Copy:**
```
From 'busy freelancer' to 'R$20K per client':

How one consultant realized her biggest mistake:

She was UNDERCHARGING for her biggest strength.

Her clients would call her for the same problem, again and again.

She solved it faster each time (pattern recognition).

But she charged the same rate as everyone else.

Then she named the pattern.
Created a framework.
Changed the positioning.

Same work.
But now it's Method™.

Price went 3x.
Client load cut in half.
Stress went down 70%.

Revenue stayed the same.
But hours dropped from 60 to 25/week.

How? She outsourced everything else. Kept only genius.

Is this you?

Take our quiz. See if you have an invisible pattern like this.

```

**Post Format:**
1. Paste text above
2. Add [QUIZ LINK] in first comment
3. Publish

**Expected engagement:**
- Same as Post 1
- Higher click rate (30-60) due to social proof

---

### POST 3 (SATURDAY) - Objection Handling

**Copy:**
```
"But what if my method isn't special?"

Every time I ask an expert this, here's what happens:

Their clients say: "Your method IS special. We can't find anyone else who does it like you."

The expert says: "Really? But it seems obvious to me."

That's the signal. If it's obvious to you = invisible to others = proprietary pattern.

The fact that you CAN'T see it = proof that it's rare.

Most people can't see patterns. They see tasks.

You see patterns. That's your genius.

But you're undercharging for it.

Stop.

Take 5 minutes. Do the quiz. Get your score.

Then let's talk about what this pattern is worth.

Spoiler: Way more than you think.

2. Add [QUIZ LINK] in first comment
3. Publish

**Expected engagement:**
- Impressions: 800-1,500
- Clicks: 30-80
- Quiz starts: 8-15

## REPEAT PATTERN FOR WEEK 4

**Rotate posts** (don't repeat same content):

### WEEK 4 - POST 4 (TUESDAY)

**New Angle: Numbers**

```
Quick math:

Option A (Freelancer model):
- 20 clients × R$5K = R$100K
- Hours: 60/week
- Stress: 9/10
- Freedom: 2/10

Option B (Method owner model):
- 5 clients × R$20K = R$100K
- Hours: 25/week
- Stress: 3/10
- Freedom: 8/10

Same revenue.
Different life.

What's the difference?

You named your invisible method.
Made it proprietary.
Positioned it as IP (not service work).

Your clients paid 4x more because the value jumped 4x.

Not because you worked harder.

Want to see if you have a pattern like this?

Take the quiz. Takes 5 min.

```

---

### WEEK 4 - POST 5 (THURSDAY)

**New Angle: Identity**

```
"I'm just a consultant"

vs

"I'm the creator of the [Method™]"

Different identities. Different markets. Different prices.

Most experts stay in identity #1.

They compete on experience + credentials.

Experts who shift to identity #2?

They compete on differentiation + IP.

Big difference in pricing power.

If you're sick of competing on price, let's shift your identity.

First step: Understand your invisible pattern.

Quiz is free. 5 minutes.

Tell me what you're seeing that others miss.

Link in first comment 👇
```

---

### WEEK 4 - POST 6 (SATURDAY)

**New Angle: Permission**

```
You don't need permission to raise your prices.

You need clarity on your value.

Most experts stay in the R$5K-R$15K range because:

1. They don't know what they're selling (service work)
2. They don't know what it's worth (guessing)
3. They don't have a framework (winging it)

Then someone with half their experience charges R$30K.

And gets it.

How? They have a named method.

Clients buy methods, not hours.

Want to know if you have a method?

Take the quiz. See your score.

Then let's talk about what you're actually selling.

# B. LINKEDIN OUTREACH

## 20 Messages Per Week (Automated + Personal)

### TARGET PROFILE

Who to message:
- Service providers (coaches, consultants, freelancers)
- Solo founders (indie makers)
- Recent job changes (people going independent)
- Keywords: "consultant", "freelancer", "coach", "strategist", "advisor"

**Where to find:**
1. LinkedIn search: "consultant" + your niche
2. Sales Navigator (if you have premium)
3. Referrals (people who know people)

---

### OUTREACH TEMPLATE 1: WARM (People you know)

**Subject/Connection note:**
```
"Your method might be worth more"
```

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

I was thinking about our last conversation about your [service].

You mentioned how [specific outcome they deliver].

And I realized: that's actually a really rare pattern.

Most [your niche] do it differently.

You do it with [your method's unique angle].

That's worth more than you're probably charging.

How much are you getting per [project/engagement]?

(I ask because I'm seeing a trend - people like you are increasing prices 2-3x once they name their method.)

Curious if you've thought about this?

Talk soon,
Robson
```

---

### OUTREACH TEMPLATE 2: WARM-ISH (Referral)

**Subject/Connection note:**
```
"Quick question for experts in [niche]"
```

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

[Mutual contact] mentioned you're doing great work in [area].

I'm doing some research on how experts price their services.

Quick question: When you look at your best clients, do they hire you for similar outcomes?

(I ask because almost every expert I talk to has this invisible pattern - they solve the same problem repeatedly - but price it the same as generic service work.)

If that resonates, I have a free tool that helps identify what that pattern is worth.

No strings attached.

What do you think?

Talk soon,
Robson
```

---

### OUTREACH TEMPLATE 3: COLD (Cold outreach)

**Subject/Connection note:**
```
"Your method is probably worth 3x more"
```

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

I help experts identify their invisible method and price it like IP instead of service work.

Your LinkedIn suggests you're in [niche] - which usually means you have a repeatable process your best clients hire you for.

Am I right?

If yes: I have a free 5-minute quiz that shows where you stand.

It's designed for people like you.

No pitch. No sales call. Just insight.

Interested?

Talk soon,
Robson
```

# C. ARTICLE PUBLICATION

## 1,200 Word Article for Medium/Substack

### TITLE
```
"Why Experts Stay Poor: The Invisible Pattern Problem"
```

### FULL ARTICLE

```
I was charging R$5K per project.

My best clients would call me back 5-6 times per year.

So I was making R$30K/year from my best relationships.

But one day, I realized something:

Every time they called, it was the same problem.

I was solving the same puzzle. Different packaging.

But I was charging the same rate.

That's when I realized: I had an invisible method.

And it was worth way more than R$5K.

This is the pattern I see in almost every expert I meet.

---

## What's an Invisible Pattern?

It's when:
- Your clients always come back
- For the same outcome (even if they describe it differently)
- You solve it faster each time
- You make it look easy

But because it LOOKS easy, you price it like service work.

Not like intellectual property.

The fix: Make it visible. Name it. Charge for it.

Example from my work:

I help experts identify patterns in their business.

But I don't charge per hour.

I charge R$20K per engagement.

Same work. Different positioning.
Different price. Different business model.

---

## Why It Matters

If your method stays invisible:

1. You stay poor (stuck in freelance economics)
   - R$5K × 20 clients = R$100K (exhausting)
   - 60 hours/week
   - Always one client away from bankruptcy

2. Your expertise dies with you (not scalable)
   - Can't train anyone
   - Can't delegate
   - Can't multiply your impact

3. You compete on price (not IP)
   - Someone always underbids you
   - Clients see you as interchangeable
   - You're commoditized

4. You work too much (not systematized)
   - Everything depends on you
   - No time for strategic work
   - Burnout incoming

If you make it visible:

1. You charge 3-4x more
   - R$20K × 5 clients = R$100K (same revenue, different life)
   - 25 hours/week
   - Sustainable

2. Your method becomes an asset
   - Can be documented
   - Can be trained
   - Can be multiplied

3. You compete on differentiation
   - You're the only one with YOUR method
   - Clients choose you, not your price
   - You own the category

4. You work less, make more
   - Operations can be delegated
   - You stay in genius zone
   - Sustainable growth

## How to Find Yours

3 questions to identify your invisible pattern:

**Question 1: What problem do your best clients hire you for repeatedly?**

Think about your top 5 clients.
What's the one thing they all hire you for?

Not the surface thing (they'll say "I need [X]").
The underlying pattern (the real problem you solve).

For me: Experts see patterns invisibly. They need help making them visible.

**Question 2: How do you solve it faster/better than anyone else?**

What's your process?
What framework do you use?
What's different about how you approach it?

For me: I ask very specific questions that help them see their own pattern.
Then I name it.
Then I show them the market value.

**Question 3: What framework do you use (even if you don't call it that)?**

You probably don't call it a "framework."
But you have one.

You follow steps. You ask certain questions. You have a sequence.

Write it down.
That's your method.

If you can answer these 3 questions, you've found your pattern.

Now: Name it. Document it. Price it.

---

## The Math

Here's why this matters:

**Before (Invisible Method):**
- Price: R$5-10K per project
- Clients per year: 15-20
- Revenue: R$75-150K/year
- Hours: 60/week
- Business model: Service work

**After (Visible Method):**
- Price: R$20-30K per engagement
- Clients per year: 4-6
- Revenue: R$80-180K/year
- Hours: 25/week
- Business model: Intellectual property

Same revenue.
Different life.

The difference: Your method went from invisible to visible.

---

## Three Steps

1. **Extract:** Understand your invisible pattern
   - Ask yourself the 3 questions above
   - Document your process
   - Identify what makes you different

2. **Name it:** Create a proprietary name
   - "Your Method™"
   - Should reflect the transformation
   - Should be pronounceable and memorable

3. **Price it:** Charge like IP, not service work
   - Calculate the value (10:1 ROI rule)
   - Set price at 10% of value created
   - Communicate value first, price second

If you have an invisible pattern:

The cost of staying invisible is R$50-100K/year in lost revenue.

The investment to make it visible: A few hours of reflection.

Your move.
