## 💡 TIPS FOR READING

### How to read effectively:

1. **Print or have 2 screens open**
   - One for reading
   - One for taking notes
   - Or print sections you want to annotate

2. **Take notes as you go**
   - What surprises you?
   - What questions do you have?
   - What do you want to change?
   - Write these down

3. **Don't get lost in details**
   - Your first read is for UNDERSTANDING
   - You'll do execution reads later
   - Just grasp the concepts
   - Details don't matter yet

4. **Read in one sitting or split up**
   - Option A: Read all 4-5 hours in one day (immersive)
   - Option B: Split over 3-4 days (1 hour per day)
   - I recommend: Do it over 1-2 days max
   - Don't let it drag on (you'll lose momentum)

5. **After each section, ask yourself:**
   - "Do I understand this?"
   - "Could I explain this to someone?"
   - "What questions do I have?"
   - "What would I change?"
