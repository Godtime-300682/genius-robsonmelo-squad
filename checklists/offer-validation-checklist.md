4. Document case studies

---

### 32-35 points: STRONG OFFER ⚠️
**Status:** Solid offer, but strengthen weak areas before full launch.

**Common Gaps:**
- Missing proof/testimonials (Section 2.1)
- No clear guarantee (Section 2.4)
- Bonus stack underwhelming (Section 5.3)

**Next Steps:**
1. Address specific gaps (review low-scoring sections)
2. Run 1-2 beta clients to build proof
3. Add bonuses to increase perceived value
4. Revisit this checklist after beta clients
5. Launch with refined offer

---

### 28-31 points: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT 🔧
**Status:** Offer has potential but isn't ready for premium pricing yet.

**Common Issues:**
- Dream outcome not specific enough (Section 1.1)
- No unique mechanism (Section 2.2)
- Too much client effort required (Section 4.1)
- Value ratio below 5:1 (Section 5.1)

**Next Steps:**
1. Sharpen dream outcome (use client's exact language from value conversation)
2. Create/name your unique mechanism
3. Add done-for-you elements to reduce client effort
4. Run value conversation to quantify higher value
5. Return to this checklist after refinements

---

### Below 28 points: MAJOR GAPS ⛔

2. Run value conversations with 5 ideal clients (use value-conversation-template.md)
3. Document proof (even if beta/pilot clients)
4. Use create-grand-slam-offer.md task to rebuild offer
5. Return to this checklist in 30 days

---

## FAILURE MODES (Common Reasons Offers Fail Validation)

### Failure Mode 1: "Vague Outcome"
**Symptom:** Low score in Section 1.1 (Outcome Specificity)

**Example:**
- ❌ "Help you grow your consulting business"
- ✅ "Achieve R$100K/month revenue with 5 clients @ R$20K each within 90 days"

**Fix:** Get specific. Use numbers, timeframes, and vivid details. Use client's language from value conversation.

---

### Failure Mode 2: "No Proof"
**Symptom:** Low score in Section 2.1 (Proof & Social Validation)

**Example:**
- ❌ "This will definitely work" (but no case studies)
- ✅ "I've helped 12 consultants achieve this, including [NAME] who went from R$30K to R$120K/month in 75 days"

**Fix:** Run 2-3 beta engagements (even at reduced rate) to build case studies and testimonials.

---

### Failure Mode 3: "Too Slow"
**Symptom:** Low score in Section 3 (Time Delay)

**Example:**
- ❌ "6-month transformation with results in month 5-6"
- ✅ "90-day transformation with first client closed by Day 30"

**Fix:** Compress timeline. Deliver quick wins early (Day 7, Day 14). Break into sprints.

---

### Failure Mode 4: "Too Much Work"
**Symptom:** Low score in Section 4.1 (Ease of Implementation)

**Example:**
- ❌ "You'll build everything using our templates and frameworks" (DIY)
- ✅ "We'll build your method WITH you in live sessions—you show up, we document" (Done WITH You)

**Fix:** Shift from "guided DIY" to "done WITH you." Add live sessions, reviews, done-for-you elements.

---

### Failure Mode 5: "Weak Value Ratio"
**Symptom:** Low score in Section 5.1 (Value-to-Price Ratio)

**Example:**
- ❌ R$50K fee for R$150K value (3:1 ratio)
- ✅ R$200K fee for R$1.4M value (7:1 ratio)

**Fix:** Either (a) increase value delivered, or (b) run better value conversation to quantify intangibles.

---

### Failure Mode 6: "No Bonuses"
**Symptom:** Low score in Section 5.3 (Bonus Stack)

**Example:**
- ❌ "R$200K for the core program"
- ✅ "R$200K for core program + R$15K in bonuses (proposal reviews, first client guarantee, resource library)"

**Fix:** Add 3-5 high-value bonuses. Total bonus value should exceed the core price.
