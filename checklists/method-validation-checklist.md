## INTERPRETATION

### 38-44 points: LAUNCH READY ✅
**Status:** Your method is market-ready. Proceed to market launch.

**Next Steps:**
1. Finalize sales materials (deck, proposal template, website copy)
2. Launch outbound campaign (target 20 conversations in 30 days)
3. Close first 3 clients to validate pricing
4. Document case studies
5. Iterate based on feedback

---

### 35-37 points: NEARLY READY ⚠️
**Status:** Solid foundation, but address gaps before full launch.

**Common Gaps:**
- Missing case studies/testimonials (Section 3.4)
- Pricing not fully validated (Section 5.1)
- Systematization incomplete (Section 4.2)

**Next Steps:**
1. Address specific gaps (review low-scoring sections)
2. Run beta program with 1-2 clients at reduced rate to build proof
3. Document everything as you deliver
4. Revisit this checklist in 30 days

---

### 30-34 points: NEEDS WORK 🔧
**Status:** Core method exists but not ready for premium pricing.

**Common Issues:**
- Pattern not unique enough (Section 1.2)
- Documentation incomplete (Section 2)
- No clear differentiation (Section 3)

**Next Steps:**
1. Refine your pattern (make it more specific and unique)
2. Complete all documentation (framework, process, examples)
3. Test with 1 pilot client for free or at cost
4. Return to this checklist after pilot

---

### Below 30 points: START OVER ⛔
**Status:** This is not a method yet—it's an idea or service offering.

**Recommendation:**
1. Return to pattern identification (use genius-robsonmelo-chief agent)
2. Run codify-method task from scratch
3. Focus on ONE specific pattern, not multiple
4. Study 3 successful methods in your space
5. Revisit this checklist in 60 days

---

## FAILURE MODES (Common Reasons Methods Fail Validation)

### Failure Mode 1: "Everything for Everyone"
**Symptom:** Target market is too broad, pattern is generic

**Example:**
- ❌ "I help businesses grow"
- ✅ "I help SaaS founders break through the $1M ARR ceiling using the Revenue Architecture Method™"

**Fix:** Narrow your focus to a specific pattern + specific audience.

---

### Failure Mode 2: "It's All In My Head"
**Symptom:** Low scores in Section 2 (Documentation)

**Example:**
- ❌ "I know how to do it, I just need to document it"
- ✅ "I have a 40-page playbook with diagrams, scripts, and examples"

**Fix:** Block 2 full days to document everything. Use templates from this squad.

---

### Failure Mode 3: "I'm Not Sure What Makes It Unique"
**Symptom:** Low scores in Section 1.2 (Uniqueness) and 3.1 (Positioning)

**Example:**
- ❌ "I do strategic consulting"
- ✅ "Unlike generic strategy consultants who analyze, I codify your invisible expertise into a proprietary method"

**Fix:** Study 10 competitors. Document what they do. Position AGAINST them.

---

### Failure Mode 4: "I Can't Prove It Yet"
**Symptom:** Low scores in Section 3.4 (Proof) and 6.1 (Validation)

**Example:**
- ❌ "I know this works, I just haven't done it for clients yet"
- ✅ "I've delivered this to 5 clients with average R$200K value created per client"

**Fix:** Run 2-3 beta engagements (even for free) to build case studies.

---

### Failure Mode 5: "It's All Me, Can't Be Systematized"
**Symptom:** Low scores in Section 4.2 (Systematization) and 4.3 (Scalability)

**Example:**
- ❌ "My genius is required for every step"
- ✅ "80% follows documented procedures, 20% requires my pattern-matching"

**Fix:** Separate WHAT you do (can be documented) from HOW you think (genius). Systematize the WHAT.
