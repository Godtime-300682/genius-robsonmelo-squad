## FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS

Common reasons quality gates fail:

### QG-GR-001 Failures (Method Not Ready)

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Pattern too broad** | "I help everyone with everything" | Narrow to ONE specific pattern + audience |
| **No documentation** | "It's all in my head" | Block 2 days, document everything |
| **No proof** | "I know it works, just haven't done it" | Run 2-3 beta clients for case studies |
| **Not unique** | "Same as 100 other consultants" | Position AGAINST alternatives, name your mechanism |

---

### QG-GR-002 Failures (Offer Not Strong)

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Vague outcome** | "Help you succeed" | Get specific: numbers + timeframe |
| **Low value ratio** | Price feels expensive | Run better value conversation (quantify intangibles) |
| **Too slow** | 6-month timeline | Compress to 90 days, deliver quick wins |
| **Too much work** | Client does everything | Shift to "done WITH you," add live sessions |

---

### QG-GR-003 Failures (Delivery Not Systematized)

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **No documentation** | Can't train anyone else | Document all procedures (Sam Carpenter's method) |
| **Everything is custom** | Reinvent wheel every client | Standardize 80%, customize 20% |
| **No financial system** | Chaotic cash flow | Implement Profit First (5 accounts) |
| **Quality inconsistent** | Some clients love it, some don't | Create quality checklists, review before delivery |

---

### QG-GR-004 Failures (No Market Gravity)

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **100% outbound** | Always chasing clients | Create lead magnets, publish thought leadership |
| **Generic positioning** | Known for nothing specific | Own ONE pattern/method, relentlessly consistent |
| **No referrals** | Past clients don't send leads | Formalize referral process, ask explicitly |
| **No content** | Invisible online | 1 post/week minimum, method-focused content |
