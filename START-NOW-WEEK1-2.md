Click: **Sequences** → **Create new**

**Email 1: Subject "Your Expert Readiness Score: [X]/60"**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for taking the quiz.

Your score: [X]/60

You're in the "Not Ready" category.

What this means:
→ You have expertise
→ Your method is still invisible
→ You're pricing like a freelancer

Good news: Every expert starts here.

Option 1: Book a free diagnostic (90 min)
I'll extract your pattern and show you what it's worth.

[BUTTON] "Book Diagnostic"

Option 2: Just reply to this email
Tell me what's blocking you.

Talk soon,
Robson
```

**Email 2: Subject "The 3 Mistakes Experts Make With Pricing"**
```
Hi [Name],

I see this pattern constantly:

Mistake #1: You charge per hour
→ You stay poor

Mistake #2: You compare yourself to competitors
→ You underprice

Mistake #3: You don't have a named method
→ Clients see "consulting" not IP

The fix?

Name your method. Document it. Price it like IP.

Then you charge R$20K+ and clients say "yes" without blinking.

Want to see how?

[BUTTON] "Book Call"

Robson
```

**Email 3: Subject "How [Expert Name] Went From R$5K to R$20K"**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick case study:

Sarah was a consultant charging R$5K/project.
Busy - 15 clients at a time.
Exhausted and broke.

Then she noticed: Every client hired her for the same outcome.

She had an invisible pattern.

So we named it. Documented it. Priced it: R$25K.

Result:
→ 5 clients @ R$25K = R$125K/month (same effort)
→ 25 hours/week (not 60)

Is this you?

[BUTTON] "Book Diagnostic Call"

Talk soon,
Robson
```

**Email 4: Subject "3 Signs You're Closer to Scaling Than You Think"**
```
Hi [Name],

Sign #1: Repeat clients hire you for similar outcomes
→ That's your invisible pattern

Sign #2: Clients love your process
→ That's your methodology showing through

Sign #3: Hard time explaining what makes you different
→ That's what we make visible

If you have all 3: You're ready to scale.

[BUTTON] "Book Diagnostic Call"

Talk soon,
Robson
```

**Email 5: Subject "Last Chance for This Month's Diagnostic"**
```
Hi [Name],

Spots are filling up.

2 left for this month.

In 90 minutes, we'll extract your pattern,
name your method,
and calculate what it's worth.

Free. No obligation.

[BUTTON] "Book Diagnostic - Limited Spots"

Your move.

Talk soon,
Robson
