Subject: "Diagnostic Session Tomorrow - Quick Prep"

Hi [Name],

Excited for our call tomorrow at [TIME].

To make the most of our 90 minutes, here's what would help:

Before we hop on:
1. Think about your best client engagement (start to finish)
2. Jot down: What changed for them? What's different now?
3. Think: Why do your best clients keep coming back?

On the call, I'll ask you to walk me through it.

Then we'll extract the pattern and show you what it's worth.

Looking forward to it!

Talk soon,
Robson
```

## THE CALL STRUCTURE (90 min)

### PHASE 1: PATTERN EXTRACTION (30 min)

**Your opening (2 min):**
```
"Thanks for being here. This next 90 minutes is about understanding the pattern
that makes you valuable. By the end, you'll know:

1. What your invisible method actually is
2. What to call it
3. What it's worth

Sound good? Let's go."
```

**Question 1 - Best Client Story (10 min):**
```
"Walk me through one of your best client engagements.

Start with: How did you meet?
Then: What did you do?
End with: What changed for them?"

[LISTEN. Don't interrupt. Take notes.]

LISTEN FOR:
- The process steps (how you work)
- The transformation (what changed)
- The timeline (how long)
- The speed (did you solve it faster than they expected)
- The client feedback ("You're so good at...")
```

**Question 2 - Pattern Recognition (8 min):**
```
"Great story. Here's what I'm hearing:

[Summarize what they told you in 2-3 sentences]

Is that right?"

[Wait for confirmation]

"Has this pattern happened before? Another client
getting similar results from similar work?"

[Listen for: YES = it's repeatable. NO = maybe luck.]
```

**Question 3 - Visibility (7 min):**
```
"If I asked your best 5 clients to describe how you work,
what would they say?"

[Listen. Do they have a clear answer? Or are they guessing?]

"Do they all say the same thing? Or do they describe it differently?"

[If same = the pattern is visible. If different = invisible.]
```

**Question 4 - Clarity (3 min):**
```
"How would YOU describe what you do?"

[Listen. Is it clear? Specific? Or generic?]
```

---

### PHASE 2: METHOD CODIFICATION (30 min)

**Your work (10 min):**
```
"So here's what I'm hearing:

[Summarize the 3-5 step process they described]

Those are the steps.

But here's the pattern: [The real transformation happening]

Let me show you as a framework..."

[Draw or describe a simple 3-part model]

EXAMPLE MODELS:

Model 1: Extract Problem → Redesign Solution → Implement Change
Model 2: Diagnose Pattern → Clarify Position → Execute Strategy
Model 3: Identify Blocks → Envision Outcome → Design System

[Describe which model matches their work]
```

**Their feedback (10 min):**
```
"Does that match your experience?"

[They'll say: "Yes exactly" or "Not quite" or "I never thought of it that way"]

If YES: Great, we have the framework.
If NOT QUITE: "What would make it more accurate?"
If NEVER THOUGHT: Perfect, they're seeing their method for first time.

[Adjust model based on feedback]
```

**Naming the method (10 min):**
```
"Now let's name it.

You need a name that:
1. Reflects the transformation
2. Is unique to you
3. Is pronounceable
4. Sounds professional

Here are a few ideas based on what you do:

Option 1: [Suggest name A]
Option 2: [Suggest name B]
Option 3: [Suggest name C]

What resonates?"

[They pick one, or suggest their own]

"Perfect. So we're calling it: [Method Name™]

That's your proprietary method. That's what you sell."
```

---

### PHASE 3: OFFER DESIGN (30 min)

**Question 5 - Impact (10 min):**
```
"When you deliver this method, what's the impact on the client?

Let's be specific. Financial impact, time saved, revenue increase -
what actually changes in their business?"

[Listen for tangible metrics]

WRITE DOWN:
- Current state (where they are now)
- Future state (where they'll be after)
- Timeline (how long it takes)
- Financial impact ($, %, timeframe)
```

**Question 6 - Investment (8 min):**
```
"Here's where we talk about price.

Based on the impact you just described -
if you're creating [R$XXX,XXX in value],
what does it feel like is a fair investment
for a client to make?"

[Listen. They'll usually underprice.]

"So you'd charge [their number]?

Let me ask: If your method creates R$1.5M in value,
and you charge R$20K, that's a 75:1 ROI for them.

How's that feel?"

[They'll probably say: "That seems low" or "That seems high"]

If LOW: "Good, so let's price higher. R$25K? R$30K?"
If HIGH: "Let's prove the value better. Are we calculating it right?"
```

**Question 7 - Delivery Model (7 min):**
```
"Here's how we typically structure the engagement:

OPTION A - Done-WITH-You (R$15K)
- 50/50 partnership
- 4 weekly calls
- You get full deliverable
- Timeline: 4 weeks

OPTION B - Done-FOR-You (R$25-30K)
- I do most of the work
- You provide input (2 workshops)
- You get full delivery
- Timeline: 8 weeks

Which model feels better for you?"

[Listen to their preference]

"Great. So here's what we'd do..."

[Describe exactly what Week 1, Week 2, etc. looks like]
```

### UPDATE YOUR NOTES

In your tracking spreadsheet:
- Name + date of diagnostic
- Method name they chose
- Price range they seemed comfortable with
- Next action: "Awaiting go-ahead for proposal" or "Send proposal"

---

# B. VALUE CONVERSATION (60-90 min)

**[Use this if prospect needs MORE confidence before committing]**

## WHEN TO DO THIS

**Trigger:** They say "Let me think about it" after diagnostic
**Timeline:** 2-3 days after diagnostic
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes
**Purpose:** Quantify value to build confidence

---

## THE CALL STRUCTURE

### STEP 1: DEFINE SUCCESS (15 min)

**Your question:**
```
"Let's imagine it's 90 days from now, and this engagement went perfectly.

What would be different?

Paint me a picture."

[They'll describe: revenue increase, time savings, confidence, etc.]

WRITE DOWN (verbatim):
- Business metrics they mention
- Personal/emotional impact
- Specific numbers (if they give them)
- Confidence level
```

**Your follow-up:**
```
"So the big win would be [summarize what they said]. Is that right?"

[Confirm they agree]
```

---

### STEP 2: IDENTIFY METRICS (15 min)

**Your question:**
```
"How would you measure that success?

In numbers, if possible."

[They'll give: R$, %, timeline]

EXTRACT:
- Current state: [Where they are now]
- Future state: [Where they want to be]
- Delta: [The gap]
- Timeline: [How long to achieve]
- Confidence: [How likely to hit it]
```

**Example from real conversation:**
```
Them: "I want to go from R$50K/month to R$100K/month"

You: "By when?"
Them: "By end of Q2"

You: "So +R$50K/month in 6 months. How confident are you?"
Them: "80% confident if I do this right"

You: "Perfect. Let's put a dollar value on that..."
```

---

### STEP 3: QUANTIFY VALUE (30 min)

**Your math (show them):**

```
FORMULA: [Annual impact] ÷ [Years to achieve] = Annual value

EXAMPLE CALCULATION:

Revenue increase:
- Current: R$50K/month = R$600K/year
- Goal: R$100K/month = R$1,200K/year
- Delta: R$600K/year increase

Time savings:
- Current: 60 hours/week
- Goal: 25 hours/week
- Savings: 35 hours/week × R$500/hr rate = R$17.5K/week
- Annual: R$17.5K × 52 weeks = R$910K/year

TOTAL VALUE CREATED:
R$600K (revenue) + R$910K (time) = R$1,510K/year
```

**Show 10:1 ROI rule:**
```
"So if you're creating R$1.51M in value,
the 10:1 ROI standard would put the investment at R$151K.

But we're not charging that.

We're charging R$25-30K.

That's a 50-60:1 ROI for you.

The value gap - the difference between what we charge
and what we could charge - is R$120K+ that goes to you.

That's the deal: You get almost all the upside."
```

**Get their reaction:**
```
"Does that math make sense?"

[Wait for response]

"Does it feel worth the investment?"

[They'll likely say: "Absolutely yes" or "Let me think"]
```

---

### STEP 4: ESTABLISH INVESTMENT RANGE (15-30 min)

**Your statement:**
```
"Based on this value, here's how we typically structure it:

OPTION 1 - DIY (R$5-10K)
- You get my framework + templates
- 2 calls from me (check-ins)
- You do the work
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks
- You keep: R$1.5M value - R$7.5K = R$1,492.5K

OPTION 2 - Done-WITH-You (R$15-20K)
- 50/50 partnership
- 4 weekly calls (co-creation)
- You get deliverable
- Timeline: 4 weeks
- You keep: R$1.5M - R$17.5K = R$1,482.5K

OPTION 3 - Done-FOR-You (R$25-30K)
- I do 100% of execution
- 2 input workshops from you
- You get full delivery
- Timeline: 8 weeks
- You keep: R$1.5M - R$27.5K = R$1,472.5K

Which one feels right for your situation?"
```

**Listen to their answer:**
```
If they name a price: "Great, so [price point] is your comfort zone?"
If they pick an option: "Perfect, let's go with Option [X]"
If they negotiate: "I hear you. Here's what's negotiable..."
If they hesitate: "What would make this feel more comfortable?"
```

---

# D. CLOSING CALL (30-45 min)

## THE CALL STRUCTURE

### OPENING (5 min)

**Your statement:**
```
"Hey [Name], thanks for reading the proposal. How are you feeling?"

[Listen - don't interrupt yet. Let them speak.]
```

**Gauge their response:**
- Positive ("Love it") → Move to close
- Hesitant ("Impressed but...") → Address concerns
- Objection ("The investment...") → Handle objection

---

### ADDRESSING CONCERNS (10-20 min)

**CONCERN 1: "The investment is too high"**

```
YOUR RESPONSE:
"I get that. Let me ask - if we hit all the metrics in the proposal,
what's that worth to you?"

[They'll reference the R$1.5M from proposal]

"Right. So R$25K is 1.7% of the value we'll create.
Does that make sense?"

[Pause]

"If the ROI isn't there, I don't want your money either.
So let's make sure we're aligned on value first."

[If still concerned, offer payment plan]

"We can do 3 payments instead of 1: R$8.3K per month for 3 months. Better?"
```

**CONCERN 2: "I need to think about it"**

```
YOUR RESPONSE:
"Totally fair. What do you need to think about?
Let's address it now so you're not sitting on this."

[Wait for real objection]

[Address it, then]

"Does that answer it?"

If YES: "So we're good to go?"
If NO: "What else?" [repeat until all concerns answered]
```

**CONCERN 3: "I want to do DIY first"**

```
YOUR RESPONSE:
"Smart thinking. Here's what the DIY option includes..."
[Recap DIY]

"That makes sense. Let me ask - what would need to happen
for you to upgrade to Done-WITH-You or Done-FOR-You?"

[They'll tell you]

"Got it. Let's start with DIY then.
We can always upgrade in Week 2 if it makes sense."

[Confirm DIY option pricing]

"So R$7.5K for DIY, starting Monday. Sound good?"
```

## CASE STUDY FORMAT

### SITUATION (200 words)

```
"Before" state of the client

[Name] is a [profession] based in [location].

Before working with Robson, [he/she/they] was:
- Charging [R$X] per project
- Working [Y] hours per week
- Serving [Z] clients
- Frustrated about [specific pain point]

The challenge:
[Client's] biggest problem was [describe the invisible method issue].

They knew they had something special.
Clients kept coming back.
But they couldn't explain why.
And they couldn't charge more.

As a result:
- Revenue was [R$X/month]
- Workload was unsustainable
- They felt stuck
```

---

### TRANSFORMATION (400 words)

```
"During" the engagement - what changed

Here's what we did:

WEEK 1-2: Method Extraction
We spent time interviewing [client] about their best client engagements.

Pattern we found:
[Client] had a 3-step process for [transformation]:
1. [Step 1 - what they do]
2. [Step 2 - what they do]
3. [Step 3 - what they do]

They were doing this repeatedly but had never named it.

WEEK 3-4: Framework Design
We built a visual framework:

[CLIENT'S METHOD™]
    ↓
[Framework visual]

We also:
- Created positioning statement
- Designed value ladder (R$0 → R$50K)
- Identified ideal customer profile

WEEK 5-6: Offer Design
We created a "Grand Slam Offer" at R$[X] per engagement.

This included:
- [What they deliver]
- [Timeline]
- [Guarantee]
- [Success metrics]

We also created proposal templates and closing scripts.

WEEK 7-8: Lead Gen + Sales
We identified [X] potential clients and sent outreach.

We worked with [client] to conduct value conversations.

[Client] closed [X] new clients during this period.

As a result:
- Method is now named and documented
- Positioning is clear
- Value ladder is built
- First new clients are in
- Revenue is increasing
```

### QUOTE

Get a powerful testimonial:

```
"Before working with Robson, I thought my method wasn't special.
Turns out it was worth R$20K+ per client.

In 8 weeks, he helped me name it, position it, and close my first
new client at that price.

This isn't just a business transformation - it's a life transformation.

I'm working 50% less and making 100% more.
That's the difference between having a job and owning a method."

## IF YOU'RE NOT HITTING TARGETS

**If diagnostics are low (<1/week):**
- Increase Week 3-4 traffic (more posts, more outreach)
- Warm up quiz leads via email before diagnostic pitch
- Book more diagnostic slots

**If conversion rate is low (<50% diagnostic → proposal):**
- Value conversation may need refinement
- Check: Are you quantifying value clearly?
- Check: Are you showing 10:1 ROI?
- Check: Are you giving clear options?

**If proposal close rate is low (<50%):**
- Closing call skills need work
- Practice handling objections
- Consider payment plans (R$25K payment plan = easier closes)
- Maybe they need more time (follow up Week 2-3 later)

**If you're overwhelmed:**
- This is GOOD (means traffic is working)
- Space out diagnostics over more weeks
- It's OK to close 1-2 per week (don't have to do 3)
- Focus on quality closes, not speed
