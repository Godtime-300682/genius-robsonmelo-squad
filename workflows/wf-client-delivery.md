- What took too long?
- What frustrated client?
- What could be automated?
- What needs better templates?

**After 3-5 clients:** Create Operations Manual (@michael-gerber) for delegable parts

---

## TIME ALLOCATION

**Typical distribution (75 days):**
- **Onboarding:** 3 days (4%)
- **Discovery:** 11 days (15%)
- **Transformation:** 35 days (47%) ← YOUR GENIUS ZONE
- **Documentation:** 15 days (20%)
- **Handoff:** 10 days (13%)

**Your time investment:**
- **High-touch (first 3 clients):** 60-80 hours per client
- **Systematized (clients 4-10):** 40-60 hours per client
- **Leveraged (clients 10+):** 20-40 hours per client (team handles rest)

---

## PARALLEL DELIVERY

**Can deliver to multiple clients simultaneously:**
- **Max 3 clients in transformation phase** at once (YOUR genius zone capacity)
- **Unlimited clients in other phases** (delegate to operations)

**Recommended:**
- Client 1: Discovery (Week 2)
- Client 2: Transformation (Week 4-10)
- Client 3: Onboarding (Week 11)
- Client 4: Discovery (Week 12)

**This creates pipeline:** Always 1-2 in transformation, 1 in discovery, 1 in documentation
