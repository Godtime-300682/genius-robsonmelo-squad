# Workflow: 90-Day Acceleration
## Execute Blueprint's 90-Day Plan to R$100K/Month

**Workflow ID:** WF-GR-002
**Type:** Time-boxed transformation
**Duration:** 90 days (hard deadline)
**Complexity:** Very High (full business model transformation)
**Owner:** Robson Melo (YOUR transformation)

---

## Overview

This workflow executes the exact 90-day plan from your Genius Zone Blueprint (Section 11) to transition from Excellence to Genius Zone and achieve R$100K/month with 5 clients @ R$20K each.

**Start State:** Excellence zone, analytical work for others, flow 1-3x/month
**End State:** Genius zone daily, proprietary method, R$100K/month, 5 high-ticket clients

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Courage over comfort** - Genius requires exposure Excellence doesn't
2. **Execute, don't perfect** - Done > perfect
3. **No analytical work for others** - Protect genius zone
4. **Weekly genius blocks** - 4h minimum, protected, non-negotiable

---

## PHASE 1: CODIFICATION (Days 1-30)
**Goal:** Method codified + deck created + 5 proposals sent + first client closed @ R$15-20K

### Week 1 (Days 1-7): Flow Mapping & Pattern Identification

#### Day 1: Flow Audit (@genius-robsonmelo-chief + @gay-hendricks)
**Task:** Map moments of genuine flow from last 3 months

**Questions:**
1. When did time disappear in the last 90 days?
2. What were you doing EXACTLY in those moments?
3. What produced something that genuinely made you proud?
4. Pattern: What's common across all flow moments?

**Expected output:**
- 3-10 flow moments documented
- Pattern identified (likely: investigating invisible patterns → codifying into frameworks)
- Confirmation: This IS your genius (not analytical work for others)

**Veto condition:** If flow moments are "analyzing for others" → Still in Excellence, not Genius

#### Days 2-3: Upper Limit Problem Investigation (@gay-hendricks)
**Task:** Identify ULP gatilho before self-sabotage

**Questions:**
1. What happens in 24-48h BEFORE you sabotage progress?
2. What specific sensation triggers "distraction/conflict/adiamento"?

**Output:** ULP trigger identified + awareness practice designed
