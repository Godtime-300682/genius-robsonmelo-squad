# Workflow: Method to Market
## End-to-End: Pattern Recognition → Market-Ready Offer

**Workflow ID:** WF-GR-001
**Type:** Multi-phase transformation
**Duration:** 4-8 weeks (depending on research depth)
**Complexity:** High
**Owner:** Robson Melo (Genius Zone execution)

---

## Overview

This workflow transforms an invisible pattern you've recognized into a market-ready, high-ticket offer (R$15K-R$30K) with complete positioning, pricing, and brand messaging.

**Input:** Invisible pattern you see that clients miss
**Output:** Complete Grand Slam Offer ready to sell

**Phases:** 7
**Agents involved:** 8 (all tiers)
**Quality gates:** 4 (all must pass)

---

## PHASE 0: Discovery & Validation
**Duration:** 2-3 days
**Agent:** @genius-robsonmelo-chief (Orchestrator)
**Goal:** Validate domain and pattern recognition readiness

### Steps
1. **Genius Zone Check**
   - Is this pattern recognition YOUR genius (not analytical work for others)?
   - Does identifying this pattern activate QuickStart (Kolbe QS7)?
   - Have you seen this pattern 10+ times in similar scenarios?

2. **Domain Positioning Check** (@david-c-baker)
   - Is your positioning tight enough to see patterns?
   - Are you in "similar scenarios" frequently enough?
   - Can you name 10+ client situations where this pattern appeared?

3. **Business Model Alignment**
   - Does solving this pattern justify R$15K-R$30K pricing?
   - Is target client profile clear (who has this problem)?
   - Is transformation measurable (ROI calculable)?

### Veto Conditions
- VETO if <10 similar scenarios observed (positioning too broad)
- VETO if this is analytical work for others (Excellence, not Genius)
- VETO if transformation unclear or unmeasurable
- VETO if target pricing <R$15K (below business model)

### Checkpoint
- [ ] Pattern seen 10+ times ✓
- [ ] YOUR genius zone (not analytical work) ✓
- [ ] Target pricing R$15K-R$30K viable ✓
- [ ] Target client profile clear ✓

**PASS → Proceed to Phase 1**
**FAIL → Return to positioning work with @david-c-baker**

---

## PHASE 1: Pattern Recognition & IP Codification
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks (includes deep work sessions)
**Primary Agent:** @david-c-baker
**Supporting Agents:** @alan-weiss (IP structure)
**Goal:** Transform invisible pattern into documented, named proprietary method

### Step 1.1: Pattern Identification (@david-c-baker)
**Task:** Articulate the invisible pattern

**Elicitation:**
- What do you see in these situations that clients consistently miss?
- What's the "aha moment" when you point it out?
- What invisible connection are you making?

**Deliverable:** 2-3 sentence description of the pattern

**Example:**
"Revenue leakage happens at handoff points BETWEEN systems, not within them. Others audit systems; I audit the GAPS. The invisible pattern: 48-hour gaps between stages kill 37% of deals."

### Step 1.2: Method Naming (@david-c-baker + @alan-weiss)
**Task:** Create proprietary name

**Criteria:**
- Unique to you (not generic)
- Memorable (easy to recall)
- Descriptive (hints at transformation)
- Ownable (can trademark/protect)

**Process:**
1. List 10 possible names
2. Test each: "Would I pay R$20K for access to [NAME]?"
3. Check: Can this be Googled? (Good if unique)
4. Select final name

**Deliverable:** Proprietary method name

**Examples:**
- "The Revenue Leak Diagnostic™"
- "The Blind Spot Protocol™"
- "The Pattern Shift Framework™"

### Step 1.3: Framework Documentation (@alan-weiss IP structure)
**Task:** Document the method (1-page framework)

**Structure:**
1. **The Problem** (what people can't see)
   - External problem (tangible)
   - Internal problem (frustration)
   - Philosophical problem (injustice)

2. **The Pattern** (what you see that they don't)
   - The invisible connection
   - Why it's invisible to them
   - Why you're positioned to see it

3. **The Process** (3-7 steps to apply your insight)
   - Step-by-step methodology
   - Decision points
   - Key activities per step

4. **The Outcome** (transformation achieved)
   - Measurable results
   - Before vs. After
   - ROI impact

5. **Why Only You** (unique positioning)
   - Your pattern-matching history
   - Your tight positioning
   - Your proprietary research/data

**Deliverable:** 1-page method framework document

### Step 1.4: Validation (@david-c-baker)
**Questions:**
- Can someone read this and understand the value? ✓
- Does it articulate something they can't easily replicate? ✓
- Would you pay R$20K to access this insight if you had the problem? ✓

**If all yes → Method codified ✅**

### Checkpoint: QG-GR-001 (Method Codified)
- [ ] Method has unique, proprietary name ✓
- [ ] Pattern articulated (invisible connection) ✓
- [ ] 3-7 step process documented ✓
- [ ] Transformation/outcome measurable ✓
- [ ] All 3 validation questions = YES ✓

**PASS → Proceed to Phase 2**
**FAIL → Iterate on framework until passes**

**Duration:** 1 week
**Primary Agent:** @blair-enns
**Supporting Agents:** @david-c-baker (positioning), @alan-weiss (value)
**Goal:** Position as expert (not vendor) and prepare value conversation

### Step 2.1: Positioning Statement (@blair-enns + @david-c-baker)
**Task:** Craft expertise-based positioning

**Framework:** Win Without Pitching
- You are NOT "a consultant who helps with X"
- You ARE "the [METHOD NAME] creator who solves Y"

**Template:**
"I'm the creator of [METHOD NAME], the only [UNIQUE MECHANISM] that helps [TARGET CLIENT] achieve [TRANSFORMATION] without [COMMON FAILURE]."

**Example:**
"I'm the creator of The Revenue Leak Diagnostic™, the only system that recovers 15-40% lost revenue by fixing invisible handoff gaps that traditional audits miss."

**Deliverable:** Positioning statement (1-2 sentences)

### Step 2.2: Four Conversations Preparation (@blair-enns)
**Task:** Prepare for the 4 discrete conversations

**Conversation 1: Probative (Demonstrate Expertise)**
- Create 5-10 diagnostic questions that reveal the invisible pattern
- Design "pattern reveal" moment (aha for prospect)
- Script: How to move from vendor to expert in their mind

**Conversation 2: Qualifying (Vet Fit)**
- Define ideal client profile (who has pattern, can pay, will value transformation)
- Create disqualification criteria (when to say no)
- Script: Mutual fit assessment

**Conversation 3: Value (Define Value & Price)**
- Prepare 4-step value conversation (see Phase 3)
- This phase prepares; execution happens in Phase 3

**Conversation 4: Closing (Help Select & Commit)**
- Define decision criteria for client
- Prepare "choice of yeses" options (see Phase 4)

**Deliverable:** Conversation scripts for all 4 conversations

### Step 2.3: Anti-Pitching Protocol (@blair-enns)
**Task:** Define what you will NOT do

**Never:**
- Pitch or present for free to "prove" expertise
- Give away strategic thinking before engagement
- Provide detailed solutions in sales process
- Compete on price or personality
- Accept "send us a proposal" without value conversation first

**Always:**
- Lead with probative questions (demonstrate pattern recognition)
- Qualify ruthlessly (mutual fit)
- Run value conversation before quoting price
- Offer choice of yeses (not single option)

**Deliverable:** Anti-pitching checklist

### Checkpoint
- [ ] Positioning statement crafted (expert, not vendor) ✓
- [ ] 4 Conversations scripts prepared ✓

**Goal:** Calculate value, structure pricing, create proposal

### Step 3.1: Value Calculation (@alan-weiss)
**Task:** Calculate total value created using 10:1 ROI formula

**Formula:**
```
Total Value = (Tangible Outcomes × Annualization) +
              (Intangible Outcomes × Emotional Impact) +
              Peripheral Benefits +
              Improved Variables
```

**Process:**
1. **Tangible Outcomes** (measurable, financial)
   - Revenue increase
   - Cost savings
   - Time savings (monetized)
   - Risk mitigation (monetized)

2. **Intangible Outcomes × Emotional Impact**
   - Confidence boost
   - Stress reduction
   - Team morale
   - Market positioning improvement

3. **Peripheral Benefits**
   - Secondary gains
   - Spillover effects
   - Future enablement

4. **Improved Variables**
   - Efficiency gains
   - Process improvements
   - Capability enhancements

**Example Calculation:**
- Tangible: R$2M revenue recovery × 1 year = R$2M
- Intangible: Confidence + positioning = R$300K equivalent
- Peripheral: Repeatable process = R$150K
- Variables: Time savings = R$100K
- **Total Value: R$2.55M**

**10:1 ROI Minimum:** R$2.55M ÷ 10 = **R$255K minimum fee**

**Deliverable:** Value calculation worksheet

### Step 3.2: Practical Pricing (@alan-weiss + @blair-enns)
**Task:** Set practical pricing based on value + market + positioning

**Considerations:**
- Calculated value (10:1 minimum)
- Market positioning (are you THE expert or A expert?)
- Client budget reality (can they pay?)
- Your confidence (first time offering vs. proven?)

**Typical Ranges:**
- **New method (first 3 clients):** 50-70% of calculated value
- **Proven method (3-10 clients):** 70-90% of calculated value
- **Established method (10+ clients):** 90-100% of calculated value

**For Robson (first offering):**
- Calculated: R$255K
- Practical: R$150K-R$200K (60-80% range)
- Target range for offer: **R$150K-R$300K across 3 options**

**Deliverable:** Pricing range (low-mid-high)

### Step 3.3: Value Conversation Structure (@blair-enns)
**Task:** Design 4-step value conversation

**Step 1: Ask What They Want**
Script: "Describe your vision of the desired future state. What does success look like 12 months from now?"

**Step 2: Identify Metrics**
Script: "What KPIs will measure that success? How will we know we've achieved it?"

**Step 3: Identify Value Created**
Script: "If you achieve that future state, what's the financial impact? Revenue increase? Cost savings? Market advantage?"

**Step 4: Find Out Willingness to Pay**
Script: "Based on that value, what would you be willing to invest? Give me a broad range."

**Critical discipline:** Don't think about YOUR price until you hear THEIRS.

**Deliverable:** Value conversation script (4 steps)

### Step 3.4: Proposal Structure (@alan-weiss)
**Task:** Create 9-part proposal (2.5 pages max)

**Structure:**
1. **Situation Appraisal** (3 sentences)
   - Current state
   - Pain points
   - Opportunity

2. **Objectives** (3-5 bullets)
   - What will change
   - Measurable outcomes

3. **Metrics** (how success measured)
   - KPIs defined in value conversation
   - Before vs. After numbers

4. **Value** (impact in client's terms)
   - Total value calculation
   - ROI articulation
   - THIS comes BEFORE fees

5. **Methodology & Options**
   - Brief description of [METHOD NAME]
   - "Choice of yeses" (3 options - see Phase 4)

6. **Timing** (project duration)
   - Phase timeline
   - Milestones

7. **Joint Accountabilities**
   - What you provide
   - What client provides

8. **Terms & Conditions**
   - Legal/admin boilerplate

9. **Acceptance** (signature line)

**Deliverable:** 9-part proposal template (populated with method details)

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Method codified with proprietary name
- [ ] Offer R$150K-R$350K created
- [ ] 5 proposals sent
- [ ] 1+ client closed
- [ ] R$150K-R$200K revenue (first client)
- [ ] Profit First active (cash protected)

### Qualitative
- [ ] YOUR genius zone activated (pattern → method)
- [ ] NOT analytical work for others (Excellence avoided)
- [ ] Flow frequency increased (should feel energizing)
- [ ] Positioned as expert (not vendor)
- [ ] Delivery systematized (not founder-dependent)

---

## Veto Conditions (Overall Workflow)

**VETO entire workflow if:**
- Pattern recognition is analytical work for others (Excellence, not Genius)
- <10 similar scenarios observed (positioning too broad)
- Transformation unmeasurable or <R$150K value
- You're unwilling to charge R$150K+ (scarcity mindset)
- Delivery can't be systematized (requires YOUR unique genius every time)

## Handoff Points

**After Phase 1 (Method Codified):**
→ Can pause here and just use method in current practice
→ Resume later for monetization

**After Phase 4 (Offer Designed):**
→ Can pause here and test offer in conversations
→ Resume for systemization + launch

**After Phase 7 (First Client Signed):**
→ Can pause here and deliver to first client
→ Resume for scaling (second offer, team building, etc.)

---

## Time Estimate

**Optimistic (focused execution):** 4 weeks
**Realistic (normal pace):** 6-8 weeks
**Conservative (part-time):** 10-12 weeks

**Critical path:** Phases 1-4 (cannot skip)
**Parallelizable:** Phases 5-6 (can work simultaneously)
**Must be sequential:** Phase 7 (requires all prior work complete)
